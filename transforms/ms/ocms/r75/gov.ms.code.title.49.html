      <p>
       “SECTION 7. Section 5, Chapter 518, Laws of 1984, as amended by Section 3, Chapter 28, First Extraordinary Session of 1984, is amended as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       “SECTION 5. (1) Nothing in Section 27-5-75 or 49-1-15 shall be construed to require employees who were hired prior to July 1, 1985, to retire prior to attaining the age of sixty-five (65) years unless, after attaining the age of sixty-two (62) years on or before June 30, 1986, and those who attain the age of sixty (60) years thereafter, they have completed four (4) years of creditable service for purposes of the Public Employees’ Retirement System, at which time they shall be retired forthwith.

       Physical fitness may be a job qualification despite the lack of formal fitness standards; the weight to be given the existence or absence of formal standards is for the fact-finder to decide, with its finding subject to appropriate appellate review on the entire record. EEOC v. Mississippi State Tax Comm., 873 F.2d 97, 1989 U.S. App. LEXIS 7098 (5th Cir. Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Because Mississippi failed to establish health and fitness qualifications reasonably necessary for job of conservation officer and for which age could be used as valid proxy, clause in Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 making it not unlawful for employer to take action otherwise prohibited where age was bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to normal operation of particular business was not available; therefore, statute (§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t49c01s49-1-15" target="_self">49-1-15</a></cite>) plainly violated Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 and was unenforceable.

      </p>

       Section 49-1-15, as amended and which became effective July 1, 1985, violates § 4(a) of Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 USCS § 623(a), in that it requires mandatory retirement of conservation officers of Department of Wildlife Conservation at age 60 and maximum hiring at age 35 and is unenforceable.

       Statute did not require that governor be present at hearing but rather required that written notice be given to the governor and the employee; even if the statute had required the governor’s attendance, the presence of his representative would have sufficed.

       Where there is nothing in the record to show cause to discharge a game warden supervisor, and an order discharging him for reasons shown by the record was unreasonable, whimsical, and capricious, and constituted a breach of his rights under this section [Code 1942, § 5841], his dismissal was not justified.

    Conservation Officers’ Reserve Unit.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      There is hereby created a Conservation Officers’ Reserve Unit, hereinafter termed “the reserve,” to assist the conservation officers in the performance of their duties. The reserve shall consist of volunteers who are approved by the chief law enforcement officer of the department or his designated representative, and the members of the reserve shall serve without pay. Reserve officers shall be in such numbers as determined by the enforcement needs, with the maximum strength of reserve officers limited to the same number as conservation officers.
     </p>
     <p>
      In order to be eligible for membership in the reserve, an applicant must be twenty-one (21) years of age, be a high school graduate or its equivalent, be in good physical condition, have a Mississippi driver’s license, be in good standing with the community, be available for training and duty, not be a member of any police, auxiliary police, civil defense, or private security agency, have never been convicted of a felony, and have one (1) of the following:
     </p>
     <p>
      An honorable discharge or honorable separation certificate from one (1) of the United States military services;
     </p>
     <p>
      Three (3) years of responsible post-high school work experience that required the ability to deal effectively with individuals and groups of persons;
     </p>
     <p>
      Successful completion of sixty (60) semester hours at an accredited college or university; or
     </p>
     <p>
      Such qualifications as are outlined in this section for enforcement officers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Members of the immediate family of conservation officers shall not be eligible for the reserve unless a special waiver is granted by the commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon acceptance into the reserve, members shall receive a temporary appointment for one (1) year. During this year of temporary status, members must successfully complete the required training and must qualify on the same firearms course as conservation officers.
     </p>
     <p>
      The reserve shall be under the leadership and direction of the chief law enforcement officer, who may designate a conservation officer to coordinate the actions of the reserve. The training of the reserve shall be conducted by a conservation officer. The reserve shall meet at least once each month for the purpose of training and transacting such business as may come before it. The chief law enforcement officer shall be notified in writing of all meetings of the reserve and the time and place of such meetings shall be recorded with the chief law enforcement officer. The chief law enforcement officer shall prepare a reserve officer’s manual with the advice and consent of the commission. The manual shall include, but is not limited to, the following: activities and operations, training, administration and duties. During active service, the reserve shall be under the direction of the chief law enforcement officer or his designated representative. When a reserve officer is on active duty and assigned to a specific conservation officer, he shall be under the direct supervision of that officer. Reserve officers serve at the discretion of the chief law enforcement officer and may be dismissed by him or by a board of inquiry appointed by the commission. Reserve officers shall furnish their own uniforms and other personal equipment if the commission does not provide such items.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission may, by regulation, require members of the Conservation Officers’ Reserve Unit to attend officer reserve training programs conducted by county or municipal agencies or at the Mississippi Law Enforcement Officers Training Academy at the expense of the commission if the commission deems such training necessary or desirable.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission may issue uniforms to such reserve officers and may authorize the issuance of any state equipment necessary for the reserve officers to adequately assist law enforcement officers. The commission is authorized to develop a reserve officer identification system to accomplish the issuance of such items in accordance with the State Auditor guidelines.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the event the commission shall determine that a member of the Conservation Officers’ Reserve Unit may attend a training program as authorized under the provisions of this section, the commission shall require that any such reserve officer shall sign an agreement, prior to attending a training program, which shall stipulate that if the reserve officer accepts employment from any other public or private law enforcement agency within three (3) years after completion of his training program, the reserve officer or the respective hiring law enforcement agency shall reimburse the Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks for the total cost of his training program. By October 1 of each year, the department shall provide the Game and Fish Committee of the Mississippi House of Representatives and the Wildlife and Marine Resources Committee of the Mississippi Senate a listing which contains each name and the respective cost of training each reserve officer received during the previous year.

   The stop and search of defendant’s pickup truck at a roadblock set up by game wardens to conduct routine game checks in a wildlife management area did not constitute a condemned intrusion on defendant’s Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable search and seizure. Drane v. State, 493 So. 2d 294, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2379 (Miss. 1986), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">482 U.S. 916</cite>, <cite class="s_court">107 S. Ct. 3189</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">96 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Notwithstanding a technical flaw in Commission on Wildlife Conservation’s regulation under the authority of which the initial stop was made, the stop of defendant’s pickup truck at a roadblock set up by game wardens to conduct routine game checks in a wildlife management area, and the search of the vehicle when, while preparing to inspect defendant’s hunting license or identification, one of the wardens detected the odor of marijuana, were authorized by Mississippi law, since the initial stop was authorized by the necessary and proper language of Mississippi Code §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t49c01s49-1-29" target="_self">49-1-29</a></cite>, and the search was permissible under Mississippi Code §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t49c01s49-1-43" target="_self">49-1-43</a></cite>, because probable cause existed after the warden detected the odor of marijuana. Drane v. State, 493 So. 2d 294, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2379 (Miss. 1986), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">482 U.S. 916</cite>, <cite class="s_court">107 S. Ct. 3189</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">96 L.

       Suit for damages against Mississippi Game and Fish Commission under 42 USCS §§ 1981 and 1983 was barred by the Eleventh Amendment. Clifton v. Grisham, 381 F. Supp. 324, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7063 (N.D. Miss. 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       Game wardens who had observed the defendant catch catfish smaller than the legal minimum by means of illegal traps in a public lake and subsequently transport them by boat to a point where he loaded them on a pickup truck were lawfully entitled to arrest the defendant and search his truck, and their evidence was admissible in court. Russell v. State, 220 So. 2d 334, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1457 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that a defendant who admitted that he was catching fish “trying to make a living” had not paid the commercial fisherman’s privilege license required by Code 1942, § 5609 was no defense to a charge of possession of undersized catfish. Russell v. State, 220 So. 2d 334, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1457 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       An admission of guilt made by a defendant spontaneously and before arresting game wardens had an opportunity to advise him of his constitutional rights was admissible against him when tried on the charge of possessing undersized catfish. Russell v. State, 220 So. 2d 334, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1457 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       No recovery allowed a riparian owner as against the members of the state game and fish commission for the value of fish taken from an inland lake under a contract between the commission and another for the removal of predatory fish and nongame gross fish, a percentage of the latter being given the contractor as consideration for the removal. State Game & Fish Com. v. Louis Fritz Co., 187 Miss. 539, 193 So. 9, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 220 (Miss. 1940).

       Where on review in the Supreme Court, the members thereof were equally divided as to whether the state game and fish commission and a contractor hired by such commission should be enjoined from removing predatory and non-game gross fish from an inland lake at the suit of a riparian owner, such injunction would be continued.

      The commission may issue permits to kill any species of animals or native, nonmigratory birds which may become injurious to agricultural or other interests in any particular community. All migratory birds, including hawks, owls, and eagles and their nests and eggs are protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and federal regulations promulgated under the act. All species of blackbirds, cowbirds, starlings, crows, grackles, and English sparrows may be killed without a permit when such birds are committing or about to commit depredations on shade or ornamental trees or agricultural crops.

    Power to issue permits for scientific or propagation purposes.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The commission may issue a permit, revocable at pleasure, to any person authorizing the holder to collect and possess wild animals or wild birds, or birds’ nests or eggs for scientific purposes, but no permit shall authorize the collection, possession, purchase or sale of migratory birds, or their nests or eggs, included in the terms of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of July 3, 1918, and the federal regulations thereunder, for scientific exhibition, or propagating purposes, contrary to the provisions of said act and/or regulations. Before such a permit is issued for scientific purposes the applicant must pay the sum of One Dollar ($1.00) for the permit; but duly accredited representatives of public educational or scientific institutions, or government departments of the United States engaged in the scientific study of birds and animals may be granted any permit required under this chapter without enforcement or charge, and no scientific permittee shall be required to obtain a hunting license.
     </p>
     <p>
      Permits to take, possess, purchase or sell rare or endangered species shall not be issued except, at the discretion of the commission, to a duly accredited representative of a school, college or university, museum or other scientific institution, or a representative of a federal or state agency for scientific or propagation purposes devoted to perpetuating the species.
     </p>
     <p>
      Permits to take game or fur-bearing animals or game birds during the closed season shall not be issued except to a duly accredited representative of a school, college or university, museum or other scientific institution, or a representative of a state game commission to restock the covers of the state which he represents.
     </p>
     <p>
      A person holding a valid permit issued pursuant to the provisions of this section may buy, sell, possess and transport, for scientific purposes, the animals and birds legally taken, and sell them alive for propagation or stocking purposes, to a person holding such a permit.
     </p>
     <p>
      When transported by a common carrier, or contained in a package, such a specimen, or any package in which same is transported, shall have clearly and conspicuously marked on the outside the name and address of the consignor and consignee, an accurate statement of the number and kinds of animals or birds or specimens, or parts thereof, or birds’ nests or eggs contained therein, and that such specimens are for scientific or propagation purposes.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each person receiving a permit under this section must file with the commission within fifteen (15) days after the expiration of his permit, a report of his operations under the permit, which report shall set forth the name and address of the permittee, number of his permit, number of specimens of each species taken thereunder, or otherwise acquired, disposition of same, names and addresses of persons acquiring same from the permittee, and number of each species in captivity and the number on hand for propagation purposes at the expiration of the permit.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission may prescribe rules and regulations governing the possession, purchase, sale and transportation of animals and birds for propagation purposes or raised in captivity under this section.

   Notwithstanding a technical flaw in Commission on Wildlife Conservation’s regulation under the authority of which the initial stop was made, the stop of defendant’s pickup truck at a roadblock set up by game wardens to conduct routine game checks in a wildlife management area, and the search of the vehicle when, while preparing to inspect defendant’s hunting license or identification, one of the wardens detected the odor of marijuana, were authorized by Mississippi law, since the initial stop was authorized by the necessary and proper language of Mississippi Code §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t49c01s49-1-29" target="_self">49-1-29</a></cite>, and the search was permissible under Mississippi Code §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t49c01s49-1-43" target="_self">49-1-43</a></cite>, because probable cause existed after the warden detected the odor of marijuana. Drane v. State, 493 So. 2d 294, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2379 (Miss. 1986), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">482 U.S. 916</cite>, <cite class="s_court">107 S. Ct. 3189</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">96 L.

   Since the probable cause requirement of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t49c01s49-1-43" target="_self">49-1-43</a></cite> applies to searches only, the fact that a regulation promulgated by the Commission on Wildlife Conservation, under the authority of which defendant’s vehicle was stopped, which permitted the search of vehicles by an officer who had no cause to believe that a violation had been committed, conflicted with the statute did not benefit defendant’s argument that the stop of his vehicle was invalid, because the stop of a vehicle is a seizure. Drane v. State, 493 So. 2d 294, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2379 (Miss. 1986), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">482 U.S. 916</cite>, <cite class="s_court">107 S. Ct. 3189</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">96 L.

      </h4>
      <p>
       The privilege created by the statute extends not only to the document that is the “environmental self-evaluation report,” but also to written communications and written opinions associated with the voluntary self-evaluation and facts gathered in preparation for the voluntary self-evaluation. Chisolm, Sept. 19, 2001, A.G. Op. #01-0486.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Imminent and substantial hazard or endangerment to the public health and safety or the environment,” as used in subection (1)(d), may in fact cover violations that have actually caused serious harm to human health or the environment at the time the court or hearing officer is making that determination, and not just future possible harm or endangerment. Chisolm, Sept. 19, 2001, A.G. Op. #01-0486.
      </p>
      <p>
       The existence of a self-evaluation report that includes a report of facts demonstrating a need for injunctive relief does not necessarily prohibit the Commission’s exercise of its enforcement authority. Chisolm, Sept. 19, 2001, A.G. Op. #01-0486.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a “whistleblower,” informant, or witness provides the Commission with information otherwise contained in a self-evaluation report, that person is not subject to sanctions sanctions under subsection (3)(b). Chisolm, Sept. 19, 2001, A.G. Op. #01-0486.
      </p>
      <p>
       A witness must respond to any discovery request that goes to the facts that underlie an environmental self-evaluation report, and only the documents and document preparation communications are protected from discovery. Chisolm, Nov. 21, 2001, A.G. Op. #01-0681.

     <p>
      The Legislature finds that:
     </p>
     <p>
      Each year, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, more than three billion medical sharps are used by individuals in their homes.
     </p>
     <p>
      Typically, these medical sharps are put into the household trash, where they become a health hazard for other members of the household and for sanitation workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      The hazard includes not only the discomfort of a needle-stick injury, but also the risk of contracting an infectious disease from a contaminated medical sharp.
     </p>
     <p>
      Regulating the disposal of home-generated medical sharps will further the public health and safety of Mississippi residents.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The Legislature hereby finds and declares:
     </p>
     <p>
      That the economic progress of Mississippi depends in large measure upon the development and use of the natural resources of the state;
     </p>
     <p>
      That the fish and game animals indigenous to the state constitute a vital segment of the natural resources available in Mississippi;
     </p>
     <p>
      That Mississippi has approximately five million (5,000,000) acres of idle agricultural land in the state which are producing mainly broomsedge and brush. Much of this land is potentially excellent game range, yet it is producing almost no significant income for the landowners. These idle acres, plus seventeen million (17,000,000) acres of forest lands properly managed for game and fish products, can contribute substantially to the total economic development of Mississippi;
     </p>
     <p>
      That there is a tremendous and ever growing need for additional knowledge of fish cultural techniques and the proper management of our environment so that not only fish and game may be increased but that Mississippi may become a more pleasant and a more prosperous state to reside in;
     </p>
     <p>
      That this chapter is specifically designed to establish a program for the discovery and dissemination of knowledge concerning the management and proper utilization of fish and game resources in Mississippi.

      Consent of the State of Mississippi is hereby given to the acquisition by the United States by purchase, lease or gift of such land in Mississippi as in the opinion of the federal government and the governor of the state may be needed for the establishment of national migratory bird refuges in this region. The state shall retain a concurrent jurisdiction with the United States in and over such lands, reserving to the state in a ceded territory full civil and criminal jurisdiction concurrently with the federal government in all violations of the state and federal laws so that civil process in all cases and such criminal process as may issue under the authority of the state against a person charged with the commission of any crime, without or within such jurisdiction, may be executed thereon in like manner as before the passage of this section. Power is hereby conferred on Congress to pass such laws as it may deem necessary to the acquisition as herein provided for incorporation in said national migratory bird refuges of such forest covered or cutover lands lying in Mississippi as, in the opinion of the federal government, may be needed. The power is hereby conferred upon Congress to pass such laws and to make or provide for the making of such rules of both civil and criminal nature, and providing punishment for violation thereof, as in its judgment may be necessary for the management, control, or protection of such land as may from time to time be acquired by the United States under the provisions of this section.

       Where the governor’s consent to the acquisition of lands for use as migratory bird refuges was unconditional, he consented to purchase as authorized by this section [Code 1942, § 5928] (including acquisition by condemnation) not only of the land itself but also hunting and other rights in the land deemed necessary to the project; and the governor’s disclaimer made nearly three years after his consent could not alter the legal effect of his original action.

       An admission of guilt made by a defendant spontaneously and before arresting game wardens had an opportunity to advise him of his constitutional rights was admissible against him when tried on the charge of possessing undersized catfish. Russell v. State, 220 So. 2d 334, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1457 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       Game wardens who had observed the defendant catch catfish smaller than the legal minimum by means of illegal traps in a public lake and subsequently transport them by boat to a point where he loaded them on a pickup truck were lawfully entitled to arrest the defendant and search his truck, and their evidence was admissible in court. Russell v. State, 220 So. 2d 334, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1457 (Miss. 1969).

      <p>
       The fact that a defendant who admitted that he was catching fish “trying to make a living” had not paid the commercial fisherman’s privilege license required by Code 1942, § 5609 was no defense to a charge of possession of undersized catfish.

       Chapter 471, Laws of 1981, as part of a continuing overall legislative design to replace justice of the peace courts with justice courts and justices of the peace with justice court judges, amended numerous sections of the Mississippi Code of 1972 affecting justices of the peace and justice of the peace courts. Although chapter 471 did not specifically amend this section, attention is directed to Miss. Const., Art. 6, § 171, amended 1975, which provides, inter alia, that “All reference in the Mississippi Code to justice of the peace shall mean justice court judge.”

     <p>
      Upon the adoption of a resolution by the commission declaring the necessity for issuance of any part or all of the general obligation bonds authorized by Sections 49-5-86 through 49-5-98 and set forth in Section 49-5-88, the commission shall deliver a certified copy of its resolution or resolutions to the State Bond Commission. Upon receipt of same, the State Bond Commission shall, in its discretion, act as the issuing agent, prescribe the form of the bonds, advertise for and accept bids, issue and sell the bonds so authorized to be sold, and do any and all other things necessary and advisable in connection with the issuance and sale of such bonds. For the payment of said bonds and the interest thereon, the full faith, credit and taxing power of the State of Mississippi are hereby irrevocably pledged. If the Legislature shall find that there are funds available in the General Fund of the Treasury of the State of Mississippi in amounts sufficient to pay maturing principal and accruing interest of said general obligation bonds, and if the Legislature shall appropriate such available funds for the purpose of paying such maturing principal and accruing interest, then the maturing principal and accruing interest of said bonds shall be paid from appropriations made from the General Fund of the Treasury of the State of Mississippi by the Legislature thereof; but if there are not available sufficient funds in the General Fund of the Treasury of the State of Mississippi to pay the maturing principal and accruing interest of said bonds, or if such funds are available and the Legislature should fail to appropriate a sufficient amount thereof to pay such principal and accruing interest as the same becomes due, then and in that event there shall annually be levied upon all taxable property within the State of Mississippi an ad valorem tax at a rate sufficient to provide the funds required to pay the said bonds at maturity and the interest thereon as the same accrues.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such bonds shall bear date or dates, be in such denomination or denominations, bear interest at such rate or rates, be payable at such place or places within or without the State of Mississippi, shall mature absolutely at such time or times, be redeemable prior to maturity at such time or times and upon such terms, with or without premium, shall bear such registration privileges, and shall be substantially in such form, all as shall be determined by resolution of the State Bond Commission. Provided, however, that such bonds shall mature in annual installments beginning not more than two (2) years from date thereof and extending not more than twenty (20) years from date thereof. Such bonds shall be signed by the Chairman of the State Bond Commission, or by his facsimile signature, and the official seal of the State Bond Commission shall be affixed thereto, attested by the Secretary of the State Bond Commission. The interest coupons to be attached to such bonds may be executed by the facsimile signatures of said officers. Whenever any such bonds shall have been signed by the officials herein designated to sign the bonds, who were in the office at the time of such signing but who may have ceased to be such officers prior to the sale and delivery of such bonds, or who may not have been in office on the date such bonds may bear, the signatures of such officers upon such bonds and coupons shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes and have the same effect as if the person so officially signing such bonds had remained in office until the delivery of the same to the purchaser, or had been in office on the date such bonds may bear.

     <p>
      The State Bond Commission shall sell such bonds on sealed bids at public sale, and for such price as it may determine to be for the best interest of the State of Mississippi, but no such sale shall be made at a price less than par plus accrued interest to date of delivery of the bonds to the purchaser. The bonds authorized by Sections 49-5-86 through 49-5-98 shall not bear a greater overall maximum interest rate to maturity than seven percent (7%) per annum. No bond shall bear more than one (1) rate of interest; each bond shall bear interest from its date to its stated maturity date at the interest rate specified in the bid; all bonds of the same maturity shall bear the same rate of interest from date to maturity; all interest accruing on such bonds so issued shall be payable semiannually or annually, except that the first interest coupon attached to any such bond may be for any period not exceeding one (1) year.
     </p>
     <p>
      No interest payment shall be evidenced by more than one (1) coupon and neither cancelled nor supplemental coupons shall be permitted; the lowest interest rate specified for any bonds issued shall not be less than seventy percent (70%) of the highest interest rate specified for the same bond issue. The interest rate of any one (1) maturity shall not exceed seven percent (7%).

     </h3>
     <p>
      The commission shall conduct investigations on nongame wildlife in order to develop information relating to population, distribution, habitat needs, limiting factors, and other biological and ecological data to determine management measures necessary for their continued ability to sustain themselves successfully. On the basis of such determinations the commission shall issue proposed regulations and develop management programs, designed to insure the continued ability of nongame wildlife to perpetuate themselves successfully. Such proposed regulations shall set forth species or subspecies of nongame wildlife which the commission deems in need of management pursuant to this section, giving their common and scientific names by species and subspecies. The commission shall conduct ongoing investigations of nongame wildlife and may from time to time amend such regulations by adding or deleting species or subspecies of nongame wildlife.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission shall by such regulations establish proposed limitations relating to taking, possession, transportation, exportation, processing, purchasing, sale or offer for sale, or shipment as may be deemed necessary to manage such nongame wildlife. Such regulation shall become effective sixty (60) days after being proposed during which period public comment shall be solicited and received. The commission may hold a public hearing if deemed appropriate. On the basis of public comments received or the testimony at any such hearing the commission may make such changes in the proposed regulation as are consistent with effective management of nongame wildlife.
     </p>
     <p>
      Except as provided in regulations issued by the commission, it shall be unlawful for any person to take, possess, transport, export, process, purchase, sell or offer for sale or ship nongame wildlife deemed by the commission to be in need of management pursuant to this section. Subject to the same exception, it shall further be unlawful for any common or contract carrier knowingly to transport or receive for shipment nongame wildlife deemed by the commission to be in need of management pursuant to this section.

     </h3>
     <p>
      On the basis of investigations on nongame wildlife provided for in Section 49-5-107 and other available scientific and commercial data, and after consultation with other state wildlife agencies, appropriate federal agencies, and other interested persons and organizations, but not later than one (1) year after July 1, 1974 the commission shall by regulation propose a list of those species and subspecies of wildlife indigenous to the state which are determined to be endangered within this state, giving their common and scientific names by species and subspecies. Such regulation shall become effective sixty (60) days after being proposed during which period public comment shall be solicited and received. The commission may hold a public hearing if deemed appropriate. On the basis of public comments received or the testimony at any such hearing, the commission may add to such proposed list additional species or subspecies which are determined to be endangered within the state or delete therefrom such species or subspecies which are determined not to be endangered within the state.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission shall conduct a review of the state list of endangered species within not more than two (2) years from its effective date and every two (2) years thereafter and may amend the list by such additions or deletions as are deemed appropriate. The commission shall submit to the Governor a summary report of the data used in support of all amendments to the state list during the preceding biennium.
     </p>
     <p>
      Except as otherwise provided in Sections 49-5-101 through 49-5-119, it shall be unlawful for any person to take, possess, transport, export, process, sell or offer for sale or ship, and for any common or contract carrier knowingly to transport or receive for shipment any species or subspecies of wildlife appearing on any of the following lists: (1) the list of wildlife indigenous to the state determined to be endangered within the state pursuant to subsection (a); (2) the United States’ List of Endangered Native Fish and Wildlife as it appears on July 1, 1974 (Part 17 of Title 50, Code of Federal Regulations, Appendix D); and (3) the United States’ List of Endangered Foreign Fish and Wildlife (Part 17 of Title 50, Code of Federal Regulations, Appendix A), as such list may be modified hereafter; provided, that any species or subspecies of wildlife appearing on any of the foregoing lists which enters the state from another state or from a point outside the territorial limits of the United States and which is transported across the state destined for a point beyond the state may be so entered and transported without restriction in accordance with the terms of any federal permit or permit issued under the laws or regulations of another state.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the event the United States’ List of Endangered Native Fish and Wildlife is modified subsequent to July 1, 1974, by additions or deletions, such modifications whether or not involving species or subspecies indigenous to the state may be accepted as binding under subsection (c) if, after the type of scientific determination described in subsection (a), the commission by regulation accepts such modification for the state. Any such regulation shall be effective upon promulgation.

       As to hunting license requirements, Miss. Code Section 49-7-5(3) states that no license shall be required of person to hunt, fish or trap on lands in which record title is vested; therefore, landowner may take coyote on his own land even if his hunting license has been suspended; this licensing requirement exception would apply only to the titled landowner, and would not exempt designated agent from necessity of having valid hunting license.

      </h4>
      <p>
       The 2002 amendment added “and shall forfeit hunting and trapping privileges for a period of one (1) year” in the first sentence of (4); and added “and shall forfeit hunting and trapping privileges for a period of two (2) years” in the next-to-last sentence of (4).
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2007 amendment, in (1)(a), rewrote the third sentence, which formerly read: “All licenses shall be valid from the date of its issuance to June 30 following its date,” and deleted the former last sentence, which read: “The application for a license under this chapter shall be subscribed and sworn to by the applicant before an officer authorized to administer oaths in this state, and for this purpose the members of the commission, the executive director, sheriffs, conservation officers and bonded agents are hereby authorized to administer oaths, but no charge shall be made by any officer employed by the commission or sheriff for the administration of the oath”; and made a minor stylistic change.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2008 amendment rewrote (3) and (4); in (6), substituted “the person convicted shall be assessed” for “any person convicted for a violation of subsection (3) of this section shall be assessed” in the first sentence, and deleted “for a violation of subsection (3) of this section” preceding “takes place” in the second sentence; and made minor stylistic changes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2010 amendment added (3)(c); and made minor stylistic changes in (4) and (5).

The commission shall designate the fee for the license. The commission shall set the crossbow season for small game. A special licensee under this section may take deer or turkey with a crossbow during the respective seasons on deer and turkey.

       Laws of 2003, ch. 516, § 1, provides:
      </p>
      <p>
       “SECTION 1. The Legislature finds Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy currently known to infect free-ranging deer and elk in Colorado, Wyoming, Nebraska, New Mexico and Wisconsin.
   The disease has also infected farmed elk herds in South Dakota, Montana, Nebraska, Colorado, Kansas and Oklahoma.
   With the discovery of CWD in free-ranging deer on the east side of the Mississippi River and the transport of CWD-exposed elk to numerous states, CWD has become a national concern.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Little is known about the biology and pathogenesis of CWD, including how the disease agent enters the animal, how it multiplies in the body, how it causes disease and how it is transmitted.
   These significant research and knowledge gaps regarding the fundamental characteristics of the disease greatly impede plans to control the disease.
   The only effective control has been the destruction of captive cervids and the depopulation of wild cervids in large geographical areas. Because of the urgency of the situation and the potential devastating effects on the native wildlife and recreational economies of the states, the United States Department of Agriculture had formed a task force to control and eradicate this disease.
   Preventing the introduction of the disease and enhancing early detection are a major emphasis of the task force.
   Diagnostic testing, monitoring of enclosures, inspections of farmed cervids and sampling of cervid populations are critical components of the detection and prevention programs.
   In addition, many states have imposed emergency statewide moratoriums on the importation of cervids.
   There has been a proliferation of unregulated wildlife enclosures in Mississippi.
   Because of the potential devastating effect on native wildlife and the recreational economy dependent on wildlife, the urgency of the situation, and the need to ensure the health and safety of native wildlife and domestic animals, the Legislature finds that a temporary emergency moratorium and chronic wasting disease legislation is warranted and in the public interest.”

       It is unlawful to take or kill game fish in any manner other than by hook and line with one or more hooks, or by use of a trot or troll line. Dip or landing nets may be used when landing a fish caught by hook and line, trot or troll lines. Shad and minnows may only be taken as bait with the aid of a dip or landing net, cast nets, boat-mounted scoops and wire baskets by residents for personal use in sportfishing. However, in private ponds or borrow pits or overflow ponds which go dry in summer and cut off from the regular streams, dip nets may be used for capturing or rescuing game fish. It is unlawful to kill or take fish of any species at any time or anywhere by mudding, or by the use of lime, poison, dynamite, India berries, weeds and walnuts, giant powder, gunpowder, or any other explosive, and no nongame gross fish shall be taken by the use of nets, seines or traps for personal use without a commercial fishing license. It is unlawful to set any freshwater commercial fishing equipment so that it extends more than halfway across the width of any stream, channel, drain or other body of water, and if commercial fishing equipment is placed in water, each piece of equipment shall be placed at least one hundred (100) yards apart. The commission shall have the authority to fix the minimum size mesh for use in barrel nets, hoop nets and seines for use in the freshwaters of this state regulated by the Commission on Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks. This authority given the commission shall not be extended to the regulation of mesh size for use in marine waters. Notwithstanding anything in this or any other section to the contrary, any person in Mississippi fishing with barrel nets, hoop nets or seines in any waters of common boundary between Mississippi and another state may use a mesh size in such nets which is the same as the mesh size allowed in the other state, where the other state allows a mesh size in such nets which is smaller than the mesh size otherwise allowable in Mississippi.

       The law does not authorize the seining of lakes which constitute part of a watercourse and which run during a portion of the year unless the ponds usually go dry in dry seasons of the year, since the public are entitled to have the game fish protected where they move from place to place during the season when the stream is a running stream, but where an overflow lake or pond usually goes dry, the fish will be lost to the public and be destroyed.

   Sentence of 30 days in county jail upon conviction of 3 counts of headlighting is in excess of that authorized by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t49c07s49-7-95" target="_self">49-7-95</a></cite> if sentencing judge intends 30 days confinement on each count, but is lawful if sentencing judge makes it clear that 10 day sentence is being imposed on each conviction with sentences to run consecutively, yielding aggregate 30 day sentence. Pharr v. State, 465 So. 2d 294, 1984 Miss. LEXIS 2033 (Miss. 1984).

      <p>
       Evidence that defendant was one of 4 persons observed in slow moving pickup truck from which spotlight was shined over fields on both sides of road and in which 2 freshly killed deer were discovered is sufficient basis upon which jury may reject defendant’s claim that persons in pickup were lost, ran upon pickup occupied by strangers and purchased deer from strangers, and convict defendant of unlawful headlighting. Pharr v. State, 465 So. 2d 294, 1984 Miss. LEXIS 2033 (Miss. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       A conviction under this section [Code 1942, § 5866-02] is warranted by evidence that defendants were driving an automobile slowly at night on a sparsely traveled highway in an area inhabited by deer, with a spotlight on each side of the car and a shotgun loaded with buckshot in the front seat.

   In a case in which a hunter had been charged with headlighting deer in violation of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t49c07s49-7-95" target="_self">49-7-95</a></cite>, and the charges were dropped, a district court’s dismissal of the hunter’s 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983 case against a Mississippi department of wildlife, fisheries, and parks employee on the basis that the hunter was entrapped by the employee was affirmed because the employee was entitled to qualified immunity; to the extent that there was entrapment by the employee’s pressure and assistance in helping the hunter to violate the state statute, there was no constitutional violation.

       A justice court judge may not suspend the minimum monetary fine imposed for a head lighting deer violation; however, a circuit or county court judge may suspend such fine if the charge is brought in circuit or county court. Moffett, Sept. 27, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0567.

       An admission of guilt made by a defendant spontaneously and before arresting game wardens had an opportunity to advise him of his constitutional rights was admissible against him when tried on the charge of possessing undersized catfish. Russell v. State, 220 So. 2d 334, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1457 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       Game wardens who had observed the defendant catch catfish smaller than the legal minimum by means of illegal traps in a public lake and subsequently transport them by boat to a point where he loaded them on a pickup truck were lawfully entitled to arrest the defendant and search his truck, and their evidence was admissible in court. Russell v. State, 220 So. 2d 334, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1457 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that a defendant who admitted that he was catching fish “trying to make a living” had not paid the commercial fisherman’s privilege license required by Code 1942, § 5609 was no defense to a charge of possession of undersized catfish.

       Any resident may purchase a lifetime sportsman hunting and fishing license by filing an application in the office of the department. The license shall qualify the licensee to take all fish, game and fowl, except waterfowl, including deer and turkey, in the manner provided by law. The license shall also permit the licensee to hunt with primitive weapons and bow and arrow, and to fish in the public waters of the state, including the taking of crabs, oysters, shrimp and any saltwater fish authorized to be taken under a recreational license.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c07s49-7-153ol12">
       The department may issue a resident lifetime sportsman license at a fee to be determined by the commission at an amount not less than One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) for a person thirteen (13) years of age or older and not less than Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) for a person under thirteen (13) years of age. All lifetime licenses shall be issued from the office of the department. Each application for a lifetime license must be accompanied by a certified copy of the birth certificate of the individual to be named as the license holder, if the individual is twelve (12) years of age or under.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c07s49-7-153ol13">
       The commission shall establish proof of residency requirements for the purchase of a lifetime license, and shall also establish such restrictions on and regulations for lifetime licenses as it deems necessary and proper. An applicant for a resident lifetime license must have been domiciled in this state for eighteen (18) consecutive months immediately preceding the date of his application for a license. The burden of proving domicile shall be on the applicant.

Further, if the birth certificate of each parent reflects that each parent was born in the State of Mississippi, then any child born outside the State of Mississippi of those parents may be issued a nonresident lifetime sportsman license for the above set out fee.

     <p>
      The Legislature finds and declares that it is in the public interest to ensure the public health, safety and welfare by strictly regulating the importation, sale, transfer and possession of those wild animals inherently dangerous to humans. In addition, the Legislature finds that these wild animals may pose a threat of introducing disease that is harmful to humans and Mississippi’s wildlife. The Legislature further finds and declares that wildlife inherently dangerous to humans may be possessed only as provided in this chapter. The importation, sale, transfer and possession of these wild animals are privileges that are not to be granted unless it can be clearly demonstrated that the privileges can be exercised in a manner that does not pose unnecessary risk to the citizens of this state and indigenous wildlife.

     <p>
      The Wildlife Violator Compact is enacted into law and entered into by the State of Mississippi with any and all states legally joining therein in accordance with its terms. The compact is substantially as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      WILDLIFE VIOLATOR COMPACT
     </p>
     <p>
      ARTICLE I FINDINGS, DECLARATION OF POLICY, AND PURPOSE
     </p>
     <p>
      The party states find that:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t49c10s49-10-1ol11">
       Wildlife resources are managed in trust by the respective states for the benefit of all residents and visitors.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c10s49-10-1ol12">
       The protection of their respective wildlife resources can be materially affected by the degree of compliance with state statute, law, regulation, ordinance or administrative rule relating to the management of those resources.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c10s49-10-1ol13">
       The preservation, protection, management and restoration of wildlife contributes immeasurably to the aesthetic, recreational and economic aspects of these natural resources.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c10s49-10-1ol14">
       Wildlife resources are valuable without regard to political boundaries, therefore, all persons should be required to comply with wildlife preservation, protection, management and restoration laws, ordinances and administrative rules and regulations of all party states as a condition precedent to the continuance or issuance of any license to hunt, fish, trap or possess wildlife.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c10s49-10-1ol15">
       Violation of wildlife laws interferes with the management of wildlife resources and may endanger the safety of persons and property.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c10s49-10-1ol16">
       The mobility of many wildlife law violators necessitates the maintenance of channels of communications among the various states.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c10s49-10-1ol17">
       In most instances, a person who is cited for a wildlife violation in a state other than the person’s home state:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t49c10s49-10-1ol17A">
         Must post collateral or bond to secure appearance for a trial at a later date; or
        </li>
        <li id="t49c10s49-10-1ol17B">
         If unable to post collateral or bond, is taken into custody until the collateral or bond is posted; or
        </li>
        <li id="t49c10s49-10-1ol17C">
         Is taken directly to court for an immediate appearance.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t49c10s49-10-1ol17C8">
       The purpose of the enforcement practices described in paragraph (7) of this subdivision is to ensure compliance with the terms of a wildlife citation by the person who, if permitted to continue on the person’s way after receiving the citation, could return to the person’s home state and disregard the person’s duty under the terms of the citation.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c10s49-10-1ol17C9">
       In most instances, a person receiving a wildlife citation in the person’s home state is permitted to accept the citation from the officer at the scene of the violation and to immediately continue on the person’s way after agreeing or being instructed to comply with the terms of the citation.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c10s49-10-1ol17C10">
       The practice described in paragraph (7) of this subdivision causes unnecessary inconvenience and, at times, a hardship for the person who is unable at the time to post collateral, furnish a bond, stand trial, or pay the fine, and thus is compelled to remain in custody until some alternative arrangement can be made.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c10s49-10-1ol17C11">
       The enforcement practices described in paragraph (7) of this subdivision consume an undue amount of law enforcement time.

      It is the policy of the party states to:
     </p>
     <p>
      Promote compliance with the statutes, laws, ordinances, regulations, and administrative rules relating to management of wildlife resources in their respective states.
     </p>
     <p>
      Recognize the suspension of wildlife license privileges or rights of any person whose license privileges or rights have been suspended by a party state and treat this suspension as if it had occurred in their state.
     </p>
     <p>
      Allow violators to accept a wildlife citation, except as provided in subdivision (b) of Article III, and proceed on the violator’s way without delay whether or not the person is a resident in the state in which the citation was issued, provided that the violator’s home state is party to this compact.
     </p>
     <p>
      Report to the appropriate party state, as provided in the compact manual, any conviction recorded against any person whose home state was not the issuing state.
     </p>
     <p>
      Allow the home state to recognize and treat convictions recorded for their residents which occurred in another party state as if they had occurred in the home state.
     </p>
     <p>
      Extend cooperation to its fullest extent among the party states for obtaining compliance with the terms of a wildlife citation issued in one party state to a resident of another party state.
     </p>
     <p>
      Maximize effective use of law enforcement personnel and information.
     </p>
     <p>
      Assist court systems in the efficient disposition of wildlife violations.
     </p>
     <p>
      The purpose of this compact is to:
     </p>
     <p>
      Provide a means through which the party states may participate in a reciprocal program to effectuate policies enumerated in subdivision (b) of this article in a uniform and orderly manner.
     </p>
     <p>
      Provide for the fair and impartial treatment of wildlife violators operating within party states in recognition of the person’s right of due process and the sovereign status of a party state.
     </p>
     <p>
      If not prohibited by local law or the compact manual adopted by the Commission on Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks as a rule; and
     </p>
     <p>
      If the violator provides adequate proof of the violator’s identification to the wildlife officer.

     <p>
      As a guide to the interpretation and application of this chapter, the public policy of this state shall be to recognize the need for a concerted effort to work toward the protection, propagation and conservation of its seafood and aquatic life in connection with the revitalization of the seafood industry of the State of Mississippi, which is one of the state’s major economic resources and affords a livelihood to thousands of its citizens; and in this connection, it is the intent of the Legislature to provide a modern, sound, comprehensive and workable law to be administered by specialists, who are vested with full and ample authority to take such action as may be necessary in order to help protect, conserve and revitalize seafood life in the State of Mississippi; it being at all times remembered that all of the wild aquatic life found in the waters of the State of Mississippi and on the bottoms of such waters, until taken therefrom in the manner hereinafter prescribed, is recognized as the property of the State of Mississippi because of its very nature, as well as because of the great value of the state of the aquatic life for food and other necessary purposes.

      Conservation and management measures shall, consistent with the conservation requirements of this state (including the prevention of overfishing and rebuilding of overfished stocks), take into account the importance of fishery resources to fishing communities in order to (i) provide for the sustained participation of the communities, and (ii) to the extent practicable, minimize adverse economic impacts on those communities;
     </p>
     <p>
      Conservation and management measures shall, to the extent practicable, (i) minimize bycatch, and (ii) to the extent bycatch cannot be avoided, minimize the mortality of that bycatch; and

    Rights of riparian owners on Gulf Coast defined.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The sole right of planting, cultivating in racks or other structures, and gathering oysters and erecting bathhouses and other structures in front of any land bordering on the Gulf of Mexico or Mississippi Sound or waters tributary thereto belongs to the riparian owner and extends not more than seven hundred fifty (750) yards from the shore, measuring from the average low water mark, but where the distance from shore to shore is less than fifteen hundred (1500) yards, the owners of either shore may plant and gather to a line equidistant between the two (2) shores, but no person shall plant in any natural channel so as to interfere with navigation, and such riparian rights shall not include any reef or natural oyster bed and does not extend beyond any channel. A riparian owner shall comply with the Coastal Wetlands Protection Act in exercising the use of these riparian rights. Stakes of such frail materials as will not injure any watercraft may be set up to designate the bounds of the plantation, but navigation shall not be impeded thereby. The riparian owner shall clearly mark such cultivation racks and other structures. The commission may adopt regulations to require that the racks are adequately marked to ensure the safety of users of public waters. Any oysters planted by such riparian owner are the private property of such riparian owner, subject to the right of the commission to adopt reasonable rules and regulations as to the planting and gathering of such oysters. All bathhouses, piers, wharfs, docks and pavilions, or other structures owned by riparian owner are likewise the private property of such owner, who shall be entitled to the exclusive use, occupancy and possession thereof, and may abate any private or public nuisance committed by any person or persons in the area of his riparian ownership and may, for such purposes, resort to any remedial action authorized by law. The governing authorities of any municipality and the board of supervisors of any county are authorized to adopt reasonable rules and regulations to protect riparian owners in the enjoyment of their riparian rights, and for such purposes may regulate the use of beaches, landings, and riparian areas abutting or fronting on roads, streets or highways.

       Because riparian and littoral rights were not “real estate” but revocable licenses, a property owner could not gain standing for an action of inverse condemnation from an allegation of their infringement.

       Statute granting certain rights to erect boathouses and other structures to littoral owner up to 750 yards from shore addresses distance property owner’s littoral rights reach, not who has littoral rights. Watts v. Lawrence, 703 So. 2d 236, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 88 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Construction of boathouse more than 15 feet from lot line by subdivision lot owner who had littoral rights did not violate protective covenants of subdivision, where nothing clearly prohibited construction of boathouses on lots abutting water and many other houses had boathouses or piers.

       An assistant chief inspector of the Mississippi Marine Conservation Commission whose appointment was never submitted to or confirmed by the Senate as required by statute, was at most a de facto officer for the two years he worked for the Commission in that capacity, and when he was discharged by an order of the Commission, the Commission merely terminated the de facto status which required no action by the Governor or any hearing to remove the officer from an office he did not validly hold.

All leases shall be marked by appropriate poles, stakes or buoys of such material as will not injure watercraft, at the expense of the leaseholder. The commission shall keep an accurate book, designated “Mississippi Oyster Farms” which shall contain copies of all leases. If any lease be cancelled or expire, such fact shall be noted on the face of such lease. Lessees shall be “oyster farmers” for the purposes of any grants, aid, subsidies or other assistance from the federal government or other governmental or private agencies.

       For purpose of determining and assessing proper license fee, “charter boats”, “party boats” and “commercial hook and line fishing” boats are all subject to same licensing requirement; however, this does not necessarily mean that charter boats and party boats will be considered “commercial vessels” for any other purpose.

       These provisions apply only in cases where the foreign state carries out discriminatory practices toward Mississippi residents; thus, such provisions would not apply in instances wherein Mississippi residents receive equal treatment with the residents of the other state, even when Mississippi residents cannot carry out the same activities in the waters of the other state as residents of such state can carry out in Mississippi waters; the event which brings the amendments into play is not the prohibition by another state of an activity by Mississippi residents which they could carry out in Mississippi waters, but the prohibition of an activity in the waters of another state by Mississippi residents which is permitted to residents of that state.

    Cultivation of oyster reefs; removal of oysters from restricted areas.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      By order of the commission, the director, under the direction and control of the commission, shall employ boats, crews and laborers and shall cultivate the public reefs of the state, and shall dredge the oysters in the Mississippi Sound from places where they are too thick, and shall spread them on reefs where they are too thin, and shall carry shells from the factories and spread them in places where the oyster beds can be improved and enlarged. The department may purchase other materials as may be equally suitable for the propagation of oysters. The department in cultivating the reefs, transplanting and spreading oysters and shells and other suitable materials, may expend any funds available for that purpose. In taking seed oysters, care shall be used to not injure or destroy the merchantable oysters on the reefs from which they are taken. The seed oysters shall be tonged from the “conner” or seed reefs, unless it is practicable and safe to dredge those oysters. The commission may, by orders spread on its minutes, establish new bedding grounds at those places within the boundaries of the state as it may determine, on advice of the director, or on advice of technical governmental experts, or competent aquatic biologists. On existing public reefs in which oysters exist and in waters not of a safe sanitary quality as determined by the department, the commission shall prohibit any person, firm or corporation from taking oysters from those areas. The commission shall from time to time remove the oysters from the areas and relay or replant them in an approved area for a period of time under Section 49-15-36 before they may be harvested. The commission may transport the oysters to an onshore, molluscan depuration facility for the purpose of proving depuration technology and for other experimental purposes. In connection with the testing of onshore, molluscan depuration technology, the commission may sell or dispose of the relaid oysters in a manner consistent with all applicable state and federal laws and regulations. Any funds received from the sale of the oysters shall be used in a like manner as those funds received under Section 49-15-38.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the commission finds that onshore, molluscan depuration technology proves to be successful, the commission may issue permits to private enterprise which may locate depuration facilities in Hancock, Harrison and Jackson Counties. The commission shall promulgate rules and regulations for the taking of oysters from reefs for transport to an onshore, molluscan depuration facility and for the operation of the facilities. Each depuration facility operated by private enterprise shall return oyster shells to the oyster reefs for replanting under the proper supervision of the department and under Section 49-15-38.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission may issue permits to persons to remove oysters by dredging or otherwise from water bottoms which are not of a safe sanitary quality for oysters for human consumption even though those areas may have been reserved for tonging only in Section 49-15-39. These areas shall be designated as seed grounds, and permits to persons shall be issued only for the purpose of transplanting oysters to privately leased Mississippi territorial waters. The commission may permit the transplanting of these seed oysters by a duly authorized public agency.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission may, upon certification of the department that the water bottom from which oysters are to be removed is not of a safe, sanitary quality for oyster production for human consumption and has been unsafe for a period of at least one (1) year immediately preceding certification, and upon complying with the following requirements, permit the dredging of oysters from restricted public areas and relaying the oysters to private leased grounds in the State of Mississippi:

       Section 3 of ch. 399, Laws of 1997, amended this section, effective from and after passage (approved March 18, 1997). Section 22 of ch. 579, Laws of 1997, effective July 2, 1997, also amended this section. As set out above, this section reflects the language of Section 22 of ch. 579, Laws of 1997, pursuant to Section 1-3-79 which provides that whenever the same section of law is amended by different bills during the same legislative session, the amendment with the latest effective date shall supersede all other amendments to the same section taking effect earlier.

      </h4>
      <p>
       The Legislature clearly intended that the removal of seed oysters be governed by Section 49-15-37. Therefore, the Commission on Marine Resources does not have the authority to issue permits to private entities to take oysters from waters which are not of a safe sanitary quality for human consumption for relaying or depuration in waters beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the State of Mississippi. Woods, July 27, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0480.

    Shrimping during closed season prohibited; penalties; promulgation of rules and regulations.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any operator, firm or corporation engaged in commercial shrimping during the closed season shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be punished by a fine of not less than Two Thousand Dollars ($2,000.00) nor more than Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00).
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon an arrest for a violation of this section, catch and nets may be confiscated. Any catch may be sold by the law enforcement agency making the arrest at the average wholesale price being paid for shrimp. The monies derived from the sale shall be held in escrow pending disposition of the charge. If a conviction is obtained, the monies held in escrow shall be forfeited. The monies so forfeited shall be paid to the department, to be paid into the seafood fund. If the operator, firm or corporation is acquitted of the charge or if the charge is dismissed, then the monies obtained from the sale shall be paid to the proper operator, firm or corporation. Forfeiture of confiscated nets and paraphernalia shall be instituted under Sections 49-7-251 through 49-7-257. If the person in possession of or using the nets in the violation is not the owner or licensee of the nets, the department shall notify the owner or licensee of the nets. The nets shall be subject to forfeiture unless the nets were stolen and prosecution for the theft is initiated.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission may issue special permits for the purpose of catching shrimp prior to the official opening of shrimp season, to those nonprofit organizations that are tax exempt under Section 501(c) of the United States Internal Revenue Code and which have on file with the State Tax Commission a tax exemption letter issued by the United States Internal Revenue Service. However, until January 1, 1992, the requirement that a nonprofit organization have on file with the State Tax Commission a tax exemption letter issued by the United States Internal Revenue Service shall be considered as having been met if the organization has actually made application for such exemption and has on file with the State Tax Commission a copy of its application.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission shall promulgate rules and regulations governing the taking of shrimp by the nonprofit organization and shall issue such regulations to all organizations upon request and at the issuance of the special permit.

      The contracting states solemnly agree:
     </p>
     <p>
      ARTICLE I
     </p>
     <p>
      Whereas the Gulf Coast states have the proprietary interest in and jurisdiction over fisheries in the waters within their respective boundaries, it is the purpose of this compact to promote the better utilization of the fisheries, marine, shell and anadromous, of the seaboard of the Gulf of Mexico, by the development of a joint program for the promotion and protection of such fisheries and the prevention of the physical waste of the fisheries from any cause.
     </p>
     <p>
      ARTICLE II
     </p>
     <p>
      This compact shall become operative immediately as to those states ratifying it whenever any two (2) or more of the states of Florida, Alabama, Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi have ratified it and the Congress has given its consent, pursuant to Article I, Section 10, of the Constitution of the United States. Any state contiguous to any of the aforementioned states or riparian upon waters which flow into waters under the jurisdiction of any of the aforementioned states and which are frequented by anadromous fish or marine species may become a party hereto as hereinafter provided.

The commission shall have power to recommend the coordination of the exercise of the police powers of the several states within their respective jurisdictions to promote the preservation of these fisheries and their protection against overfishing, waste, depletion or any abuse whatsoever and to assure a continuing yield from the fishery resources of the aforementioned states. To that end the commission shall draft and recommend to the governors and legislatures of the various signatory states, legislation dealing with the conservation of the marine, shell and anadromous fisheries of the Gulf seaboard. The commission shall from time to time present to the governor of each compacting state its recommendations relating to enactments to be presented to the legislature of that state in furthering the interest and purposes of this compact.

      It is agreed that any two (2) or more states party hereto may further amend this compact by acts of their respective legislatures, subject to approval of Congress as provided in Article I, Section X, of the Constitution of the United States, to designate the Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission as a joint regulating authority for the joint regulation of specific fisheries affecting only such states as shall so compact, and at their joint expense. The representatives of such states shall constitute a separate section of the Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission for the exercise of the additional powers so granted but the creation of such section shall not be deemed to deprive the states so compacting of any of their privileges or powers in the Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission as constituted under the other articles of this compact.

       The Commission on Marine Resources does not have the authority to establish criminal penalties under the Seafood Chapter of the Mississippi Code for violations of its ordinances.
   Gusa, November 20, 1998, A.G. Op. #98-0692.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until such time as the Mississippi Commission on Marine Resources is reconstituted in 2002, it must have in its membership two members from each coastal county; thus, if a board member appointed to represent one coastal county moves to another coastal county, the move will result in a vacancy requiring special appointment by the Governor. Woods, June 2, 2000, A.G. Op. #2000-0286.
      </p>
      <p>
       The members of the Mississippi Commission on Marine Resources designated to represent the commercial seafood processors, commercial fishermen, charter board operators, and nonseafood industry must be residents of the county in which their business is located; thus, if an individual representing one of these industries moves to another county, that will create a vacancy for which a special appointment will need to be made. Woods, June 2, 2000, A.G. Op. #2000-0286.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until the reconstituting of the Commission on Marine Resources in July 1, 2002, the board must have members as detailed in the pre-amendment version of the statute, Janus, Oct. 5, 2001, A.G. Op. #01-0612.
      </p>
      <p>
       Appointments made by the Governor in vacation and not confirmed by the Senate, but who have taken the oath of office, may be “de facto” officers; and actions taken by “de facto” officers are valid. Janus, Oct. 5, 2001, A.G. Op. #01-0612.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t49c17s49-17-1" target="_self">49-17-1</a></cite>, et seq., plaintiffs could maintain a private cause of action of nuisance; if they could, the action was not time barred under Miss.

   The Mississippi Commission on Environmental Quality (Commission) acted arbitrarily and capriciously, and in conflict with the moratorium statute (§<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.17.html#t17c17s17-17-59" target="_blank">17-17-59</a></cite>), in deciding that it had no jurisdiction pertaining to the issuance, modification, revocation or transfer of a non-hazardous solid waste disposal permit while also holding that it did have jurisdiction over the parties and subject matter concerning Commission rules and regulations requiring the contract operator of the solid waste facility to hold a permit; these 2 determinations were totally inconsistent in view of the process in which §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t49c02s49-2-1" target="_self">49-2-1</a></cite> et seq. and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t49c17s49-17-1" target="_self">49-17-1</a></cite> et seq. determine the hierarchy and method in which the Commission and the Mississippi Environmental Quality Permit Board are to govern, and §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.17.html#t17c17s17-17-1" target="_blank">17-17-1</a></cite> et seq. clearly delegated authority to the Commission to enact sufficient rules and regulations to both define “transfer” and sufficiently carry out the process as a matter of important public policy.

   Bankruptcy court found that no private right of action nor remedy existed under the Mississippi Air and Water Pollution Control Law, codified in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t49c17s49-17-1" target="_self">49-17-1</a></cite> through §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t49c17s49-17-43" target="_self">49-17-43</a></cite>; while the Mississippi Air and Water Pollution Control Law did allow for private party participation, it clearly did not provide a private right of action or a private remedy for those persons adversely affected by air or water pollution.

       Where an operator of a poultry processing plant maintained a waste system preventing discharge into state waters but seepage and intermittent overflow into a natural dry creek bed occurred, particularly after a rainfall of disaster proportions, the commission had the authority to indulge the operator with a tolerance permit for such time as was reasonably necessary to either treat the waste water in the manner required or to remedy the situation where rainfall caused temporary discharge of waste water; and the commission should have done so, despite the fact that the operator was a new industry and the commission could not ordinarily issue a tolerance permit to a new plant since it had not been previously polluting state waters.

    Standards of air and water quality.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In order to carry out the purposes of Sections 49-17-1 through 49-17-43, the commission may set ambient standards of air and water quality for the state or portions thereof. Such ambient standards of quality shall be such as to protect the public health and welfare and the present and prospective future use of such air and of such waters for public water supplies, propagation of fish and aquatic life and wildlife, recreational purposes, and agricultural, industrial and other legitimate uses. Such ambient standards may be amended from time to time as determined to be necessary by the commission. In order to carry out the purposes of Sections 49-17-1 through 49-17-43, the commission may also set emission standards for the purpose of controlling air contamination, air pollution and the sources thereof. In establishing ambient air quality standards for odor, the commission shall adopt recognized objective standards if they exist. In the absence of a recognized objective ambient air quality standard for odor, the commission may adopt such subjective standards as may be appropriate.
     </p>
     <p>
      In establishing such standards relating to pesticides and commercial fertilizers for underground water, the commission shall adopt federal standards if they exist. If no federal standard exists, the commission shall petition the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to establish a federal standard for the substance of interest. If the commission determines that a federal standard cannot be obtained within thirty (30) days, it shall consult with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Drinking Water and Office of Pesticide Programs regarding the agency’s conclusion relative to available toxicological information on the substance of interest and on the methodology used for establishing a federal standard. The commission shall utilize this information and methodology to establish a standard. The commission may also consult with and request similar information from other sources.

     <p>
      The commission or its duly authorized representative shall have the power to enter at reasonable times upon any private or public property, and the owner, managing agent or occupant of any such property shall permit such entry for the purpose of inspecting and investigating conditions relating to pollution or the possible pollution of any air or waters of the state and to have access to such records as the commission may require under subsection (b) of this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission may require the maintenance of records relating to the operation of air contamination sources or water disposal systems, and any authorized representative of the commission may examine and copy any such records or memoranda pertaining to the operation of such air contamination source or water disposal system. The records shall contain such information as the commission may require. Copies of such records shall be submitted to the commission upon request.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission may conduct, authorize or require tests and take samples of air contaminants or waste waters, fuel, process material or other material which affects or may affect (1) emission of air contaminants from any source, or (2) waste water disposal systems. Upon request of the commission, the person responsible for the source to be tested shall provide necessary sampling ports in stacks or ducts and such other safe and proper sampling and testing facilities as may be necessary for proper determination of the emission of air contaminants. If an authorized employee of the commission during the course of any inspection obtains a sample of air contaminant, fuel, process material or other material, he shall give the owner or operator of the equipment or fuel facility a receipt for the sample obtained.
     </p>
     <p>

       Substantial evidence supported the Mississippi Environmental Quality Permit Board’s (Permit Board) granting of a siting variance and permit to expand a poultry farm, over a neighbor’s objections, because the Permit Board permissibly considered (1) that the neighbor rebuilt the neighbor’s home within 600 feet of an approved facility, and (2) the neighbor’s motives for contesting the variance and permit. Taylor v. Miss. Envtl. Quality Permit Bd., 205 So.3d 1129, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 164 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 205 So.3d 1082, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 529 (Miss. 2016).

      <p>
       Poultry farm owner’s failure to give a neighbor 180 days’ notice of intended construction, and the owner’s illegal operation of a poultry farm without a permit and within a buffer zone, did not bar the Mississippi Environmental Quality Permit Board (Permit Board) from granting the owner a variance from siting criteria and a permit because the Permit Board (1) considered the owner’s noncompliance and (2) had the authority to grant the variance and permit nonetheless. Taylor v. Miss. Envtl. Quality Permit Bd., 205 So.3d 1129, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 164 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 205 So.3d 1082, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 529 (Miss. 2016).

   The Mississippi Commission on Environmental Quality (Commission) acted arbitrarily and capriciously, and in conflict with the moratorium statute (§<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.17.html#t17c17s17-17-59" target="_blank">17-17-59</a></cite>), in deciding that it had no jurisdiction pertaining to the issuance, modification, revocation or transfer of a non-hazardous solid waste disposal permit while also holding that it did have jurisdiction over the parties and subject matter concerning Commission rules and regulations requiring the contract operator of the solid waste facility to hold a permit; these 2 determinations were totally inconsistent in view of the process in which §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t49c02s49-2-1" target="_self">49-2-1</a></cite> et seq. and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t49c17s49-17-1" target="_self">49-17-1</a></cite> et seq. determine the hierarchy and method in which the Commission and the Mississippi Environmental Quality Permit Board are to govern, and §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.17.html#t17c17s17-17-1" target="_blank">17-17-1</a></cite> et seq. clearly delegated authority to the Commission to enact sufficient rules and regulations to both define “transfer” and sufficiently carry out the process as a matter of important public policy.

         Any person who is aggrieved by any decision of the Permit Board issuing, reissuing, denying, revoking or modifying a permit after a formal hearing may appeal that decision within the period specified in subsection (4)(c) of this section to the chancery court of the county of the situs in whole or in part of the subject matter. The appellant shall give a cost bond with sufficient sureties, payable to the state in the sum of not less than One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) nor more than Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00), to be fixed by the Permit Board and to be filed with and approved by the Executive Director of the Permit Board, who shall forthwith certify the filing of the bond together with a certified copy of the record of the Permit Board in the matter to the chancery court to which the appeal is taken, which shall thereupon become the record of the cause. An appeal to the chancery court as provided in this section shall not stay the decision of the Permit Board. The aggrieved party may, within twenty (20) days following the date the board’s decision after a formal hearing is entered on the board’s minutes, petition the chancery court for an appeal with supersedeas and the chancellor shall grant a hearing on that petition. Upon good cause shown, the chancellor may grant that appeal with supersedeas. If granted, the appellant shall be required to post a bond with sufficient sureties according to law in an amount to be determined by the chancellor. Appeals shall be considered only upon the record as made before the Permit Board. The chancery court shall always be deemed open for hearing of an appeal and the chancellor may hear the same in termtime or in vacation at any place in the chancellor’s district, and the appeal shall have precedence over all civil cases, except election contests. The chancery court shall review all questions of law and of fact. If no prejudicial error is found, the matter shall be affirmed. If prejudicial error is found the decision of the board shall be reversed and the chancery court shall remand the matter to the Permit Board for appropriate action as may be indicated or necessary under the circumstances. Appeals may be taken from the chancery court to the Supreme Court in the manner as now required by law, except that if a supersedeas is desired by the party appealing to the chancery court, that party may apply for a supersedeas to the chancellor of that court, who shall award a writ of supersedeas, without additional bond, if in the chancellor’s judgment material damage is not likely to result thereby; but otherwise, the chancellor shall require a supersedeas bond as the chancellor deems proper, which shall be liable to the state for any damage.

       Penalty assessed against a contractor was well within the authority of the Mississippi Commission on Environmental Quality and was supported by substantial evidence of willfulness because the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality showed that the contractor had continued his construction activities even though he had been warned he was in violation of the Mississippi Air and Water Pollution Control Law. Gray v. Miss. Comm'n on Envtl. Quality, 174 So.3d 956, 2015 Miss. App. LEXIS 478 (Miss. Ct. App. 2015).

       Substantial evidence supported the finding of the Mississippi Commission on Environmental Quality that a contractor violated subsection (2) because the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality saw him violate the statute on five separate occasions; by regulation, to avoid violating the statute, the contractor had to obtain a storm-water permit, something he undeniably did not do, and thus, his unpermitted land-disturbing construction activities were a clear violation. Gray v. Miss. Comm'n on Envtl. Quality, 174 So.3d 956, 2015 Miss. App. LEXIS 478 (Miss. Ct. App. 2015).

   The Mississippi Commission on Environmental Quality (Commission) acted arbitrarily and capriciously, and in conflict with the moratorium statute (§<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.17.html#t17c17s17-17-59" target="_blank">17-17-59</a></cite>), in deciding that it had no jurisdiction pertaining to the issuance, modification, revocation or transfer of a non-hazardous solid waste disposal permit while also holding that it did have jurisdiction over the parties and subject matter concerning Commission rules and regulations requiring the contract operator of the solid waste facility to hold a permit; these 2 determinations were totally inconsistent in view of the process in which §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t49c02s49-2-1" target="_self">49-2-1</a></cite> et seq. and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t49c17s49-17-1" target="_self">49-17-1</a></cite> et seq. determine the hierarchy and method in which the Commission and the Mississippi Environmental Quality Permit Board are to govern, and §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.17.html#t17c17s17-17-1" target="_blank">17-17-1</a></cite> et seq. clearly delegated authority to the Commission to enact sufficient rules and regulations to both define “transfer” and sufficiently carry out the process as a matter of important public policy.

       <p>
   In reviewing an order by the Mississippi Commission on Environmental Quality (Commission) requiring a county board of supervisors to bring its sanitary landfill into compliance with the closure requirements of the Mississippi Nonhazardous Waste Regulations and imposing a $4000 penalty, a chancellor exceeded the limited scope of review for agency decisions where the chancellor affirmed the Commission’s order but modified it by ordering that the penalty be deposited into a separate fund to be spent curing the violations, instead of being paid into the Pollution Emergency Fund as provided by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t49c17s49-17-68" target="_self">49-17-68</a></cite>, and that any funds remaining after closure be returned to the general fund of the county; a penalty should be assessed under the same standard of review as is employed when reviewing other agency findings and actions, and therefore the chancellor had no authority to substitute his own judgment for that of the agency by replacing the penalty with one he felt was more suited to the circumstances. Mississippi Comm'n on Envtl. Quality v. Chickasaw County Bd. of Supervisors, 621 So. 2d 1211, 1993 Miss. LEXIS 290 (Miss. 1993).

       There is no suggestion of partiality or impropriety in the use of an assistant attorney general as a hearing officer in a hearing before the Department of Natural Resources Permit Board; the attorney general’s office affords counsel to state agencies and there is no conflict or suggestion of unfairness in this arrangement. Thus, an environmental organization, which objected to a modified air emissions permit and was afforded an administrative hearing before the Natural Resources Permit Board, was not denied due process of law on the ground that the hearing officer who sat with the Board was a special assistant attorney general. Furthermore, the environmental organization waived any objections it might have had where it made no objection before the Board and proceeded through the hearing without objection, and the organization admitted having knowledge of the identity of the hearing officer as an assistant attorney general well before the hearing and in time to object if any legitimate objection existed.

       Circuit court did not err in upholding the decision of the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality Permit Board, which denied as untimely a competitor’s request for a formal hearing on a permit issued to a limited liability company (LLC), because the Permit Board’s interpretation of subsection (4)(b) was reasonable; there was no relief for the competitor’s inaction because subsection (4)(b) provided finality to allow the permitting process to continue.

       Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality Permit Board did not err in granting groundwater withdrawal permits to a county utility authority because the factors it considered were reasonable, it made specific findings as to each factor, and its findings were supported by substantial evidence; the utility authority owned the land upon which it would install wells for the groundwater withdrawal and planned to use the water for public water supply, the highest-ranked beneficial use of water.

      <li id="t49c17s49-17-30ol11">
       As a condition of any air operating permit required under Title V of the federal Clean Air Act, the owner or operator of any stationary source shall pay to the Department of Environmental Quality an annual permit fee. The commission shall establish the amount of each fee to cover the costs of the Title V program as provided in Section 49-17-14.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c17s49-17-30ol12">
       To facilitate the proper administration of the Title V program, the commission is authorized to assess and collect fees from Title V program permittees. The commission is further authorized to promulgate such rules and regulations as are necessary for the development and administration of the Title V program and the assessment and collection of Title V program fees.
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t49c17s49-17-30ol12a">
         For purposes of fee assessment and collection, the maximum emission rate of each pollutant used in the calculation of fees shall be four thousand (4,000) tons per year per facility.

        <li id="t49c17s49-17-30ol12b">
         For purposes of fee assessment and collection, the permit holder shall elect for actual or allowable emissions to be used in determining the annual quantity of emissions unless the commission determines by order that the method chosen by the applicant for calculating actual emissions fails to reasonably represent actual emissions. Such order of the commission shall be subject to appeal in the manner provided in Section 49-17-41. Actual emissions shall be calculated using emission monitoring data or direct emissions measurements for the pollutant(s); mass balance calculations such as the amounts of the pollutant(s) entering and leaving process equipment and where mass balance calculations can be supported by direct measurement of process parameters, such direct measurement data shall be supplied; published emission factors such as those relating release quantities to throughput or equipment type (e.g., air emission factors); or other approaches such as engineering calculations (e.g., estimating volatilization using published mathematical formulas) or best engineering judgments where such judgments are derived from process and/or emission data which supports the estimates of maximum actual emissions.
         <p>
          If the commission determines that there is not sufficient information available on a facility’s emissions, the determination of the fee shall be based upon the permitted allowable emissions until such time as an adequate determination of actual emissions is made.

The commission may proceed with entry of the order on fees if the Advisory Council fails to submit its report in a timely manner. The order of the commission may be appealed in the manner set forth in Section 49-17-41. The determination of the fee shall be by order of the commission and shall not be considered the promulgation of a regulation by the commission. The record of the public hearing shall be included in the record upon which the order is based and shall become a part of the appellate records for all appeals taken from the order of the commission establishing or modifying Title V permit fees. Any undisputed amount due from an appellant must be paid according to the appellant’s payment schedule during the pendency of the appeal.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Whenever the commission or an employee thereof has reason to believe that a violation of any provision of Sections 49-17-1 through 49-17-43 or Sections 17-17-1 through 17-17-47 or a regulation or of any order of the commission or of any limitation or condition of a valid permit has occurred, the commission may cause a written complaint to be served upon the alleged violator or violators. The complaint shall specify the provisions of said sections or regulation or order or permit alleged to be violated and the facts alleged to constitute a violation thereof, and shall require that the alleged violator appear before the commission at a time and place specified in the notice and answer the charges complained of. Said time of appearance before the commission shall be not less than ten (10) days from the date of the service of the complaint.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission shall afford an opportunity for a fair hearing to the alleged violator or violators at the time and place specified in the complaint. On the basis of the evidence produced at the hearing, the commission shall make findings of fact and conclusions of law and enter such order as in its opinion will best further the purposes of Sections 49-17-1 through 49-17-43 and Sections 17-17-1 through 17-17-47, and shall give written notice of such order to the alleged violator and to such other persons as shall have appeared at the hearing or made written request for notice of the order, and the commission may assess such penalties as hereinafter provided.
     </p>
     <p>
      Except as otherwise expressly provided, any notice, or other instrument issued by or under authority of the commission may be served on any person affected thereby personally or by publication, and proof of such service may be made in like manner as in case of service of a summons in a civil action, such proof to be filed in the office of the commission; or such service may be made by mailing a copy of the notice, order, or other instrument by certified mail, directed to the person affected at his last known post-office address as shown by the files or records of the commission, and proof thereof may be made by the affidavit of the person who did the mailing, filed in the office of the commission.

       The air operating permit fee shall be due September 1 of each year. Any facility which proposes to use actual emissions as the basis for the fee calculation shall submit by July 1 of each year an inventory of emissions for the previous calendar year.

For facilities using allowable emissions as the basis for the fee, the fee shall be calculated based upon the allowable emissions contained in the permit on the date of the invoice.

      The hearings herein provided may be conducted by the commission itself at a regular or special meeting of the commission, or the commission may designate a hearing officer, who may be the executive director, who shall have the power and authority to conduct such hearings in the name of the commission at any time and place as conditions and circumstances may warrant. The hearing officer shall have the record prepared of any hearing which he has conducted for the commission. Such record shall be submitted to the commission along with that hearing officer’s findings of fact and recommended decision. Upon receipt and review of the record of the hearing and the hearing officer’s findings of fact and recommended decision, the commission shall thereupon render its final decision in the matter. Any person ordered to appear for an alleged violation shall have the right to request a hearing before a majority of the commission if he prefers and such a hearing may then be set for the next regular meeting of the full commission, or specially. A verbatim record of the proceedings of such hearings shall be taken and filed with the commission, together with findings of fact and conclusions of law made by the commission. Witnesses who are subpoenaed shall receive the same fees and mileage as in civil actions. In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a notice of hearing or subpoena issued under this section, the circuit court shall have jurisdiction, upon application of the commission or its representative, to issue an order requiring such person to appear and testify or produce evidence as the case may require and any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by such court as contempt thereof. Failure to appear at any such hearing, without prior authorization to do so from the commission or its designee, may result in the commission finding the alleged violator guilty of the charges complained of by default, and at such time an order may be entered, including the assessment of a penalty, which, in the opinion of the commission, will best further the purposes of Section 17-17-1 et seq., and Section 49-17-1 et seq.

       There is no suggestion of partiality or impropriety in the use of an assistant attorney general as a hearing officer in a hearing before the Department of Natural Resources Permit Board; the attorney general’s office affords counsel to state agencies and there is no conflict or suggestion of unfairness in this arrangement. Thus, an environmental organization, which objected to a modified air emissions permit and was afforded an administrative hearing before the Natural Resources Permit Board, was not denied due process of law on the ground that the hearing officer who sat with the Board was a special assistant attorney general. Furthermore, the environmental organization waived any objections it might have had where it made no objection before the Board and proceeded through the hearing without objection, and the organization admitted having knowledge of the identity of the hearing officer as an assistant attorney general well before the hearing and in time to object if any legitimate objection existed.

      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In addition to any other remedies that might now be available, any person or interested party aggrieved by any order of the commission or the executive director shall have a right to file a sworn petition with the commission within thirty (30) days after the order was issued setting forth the grounds and reasons for his complaint and asking for a hearing of the matter involved, provided that no hearing on the same subject matter shall have been previously held before the commission or its designated hearing officer. The commission shall thereupon fix the time and place of such hearing and shall notify the petitioners thereof. In such pending matters, the commission shall have the same full powers as to subpoenaing witnesses, administering oaths, examining witnesses under oath and conducting the hearing, as is now vested by law in the Mississippi Public Service Commission, as to hearings before it, with the additional power that the executive director may issue all subpoenas, both at the instance of the petitioner and of the commission. At such hearings the petitioner, and any other interested party, may offer, present witnesses and submit evidence.
     </p>
     <p>
      Following such hearing, the final order of determination of the commission upon such matters shall be conclusive, unless the petitioner, or such other interested party appearing at the hearing, shall, within fifteen (15) days after the adjournment of the meeting at which said final order was made, appeal to the chancery court of the county where the hearing was held, or of the situs in whole or in part of the subject matter of the hearing by giving a cost bond with sufficient sureties, payable to the state in the sum of not less than One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) nor more than Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00), to be fixed in the order appealed from, to be filed with and approved by the executive director of the commission, who shall forthwith certify the same together with a certified copy of the record of the commission in the matter to the chancery court to which the appeal is taken, which shall thereupon become the record of the cause. An appeal to the chancery court as provided herein shall not stay the execution of an order of the commission. Any party aggrieved by an order of the commission may, within said fifteen (15) days after the adjournment of the commission meeting at which said final order was entered, petition the chancery court of the situs in whole or in part of the subject matter for an appeal with supersedeas, and the chancellor shall grant a hearing on said petition and upon good cause shown may grant said appeal with supersedeas; the appellant shall be required to post a bond with sufficient sureties according to law in an amount to be determined by the chancellor. Appeals shall be considered only upon the record as made before the commission. The chancery court shall always be deemed open for hearing of such appeals and the chancellor may hear the same in termtime or in vacation at any place in his district, and the same shall have precedence over all civil cases, except election contests. The chancery court shall review all questions of law and of fact. If no prejudicial error be found, the matter shall be affirmed and remanded to the commission for enforcement. If prejudicial error be found, the same shall be reversed and the chancery court shall remand the matter to the commission for appropriate action as may be indicated or necessary under the circumstances. Appeals may be taken from the chancery court to the Supreme Court in the manner as now required by law, except that if a supersedeas is desired by the party appealing to the chancery court he may apply therefor to the chancellor thereof, who shall award a writ of supersedeas, without additional bond, if in his judgment material damage is not likely to result thereby, but otherwise he shall require such supersedeas bond as he deems proper, which shall be liable to the state for such damage.

   Hearings conducted solely to allow interested or affected citizens to express their views are not the type of hearings contemplated by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t49c17s49-17-41" target="_self">49-17-41</a></cite>; the type of hearing contemplated under the statute is a “full blown evidentiary hearing where interested or aggrieved parties may offer evidence in support of their position by use of documentation and witnesses, both expert and lay.” Mississippi Comm'n on Envtl. Quality v. Parker, 643 So. 2d 923, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 485 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   In reviewing an order by the Mississippi Commission on Environmental Quality (Commission) requiring a county board of supervisors to bring its sanitary landfill into compliance with the closure requirements of the Mississippi Nonhazardous Waste Regulations and imposing a $4000 penalty, a chancellor exceeded the limited scope of review for agency decisions where the chancellor affirmed the Commission’s order but modified it by ordering that the penalty be deposited into a separate fund to be spent curing the violations, instead of being paid into the Pollution Emergency Fund as provided by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t49c17s49-17-68" target="_self">49-17-68</a></cite>, and that any funds remaining after closure be returned to the general fund of the county; a penalty should be assessed under the same standard of review as is employed when reviewing other agency findings and actions, and therefore the chancellor had no authority to substitute his own judgment for that of the agency by replacing the penalty with one he felt was more suited to the circumstances. Mississippi Comm'n on Envtl. Quality v. Chickasaw County Bd. of Supervisors, 621 So. 2d 1211, 1993 Miss. LEXIS 290 (Miss. 1993).

   In an action by a citizens’ group challenging the issuance of a waste water discharge permit to an industrial plant, a public hearing solely for the purpose of permitting interested parties to express their views with respect to discharge permits was insufficient to satisfy the hearing requirement of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t49c17s49-17-41" target="_self">49-17-41</a></cite>, despite the prohibition in that section of multiple hearings on the same subject matter.

      <p>
       Penalty assessed against a contractor was well within the authority of the Mississippi Commission on Environmental Quality and was supported by substantial evidence of willfulness because the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality showed that the contractor had continued his construction activities even though he had been warned he was in violation of the Mississippi Air and Water Pollution Control Law. Gray v. Miss. Comm'n on Envtl. Quality, 174 So.3d 956, 2015 Miss. App. LEXIS 478 (Miss. Ct. App. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the Mississippi Commission on Environmental Quality found that a tire company had committed numerous violations under a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, the tire company failed to demonstrate that it was singled out, or that it was selected for prosecution based upon protected classifications. Further, the appellate court deferred to the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality’s decision regarding the methodology limits the agency implemented, which were being based on concentration limits rather than mass limits; in the latter context, the Commission acted within its power in determining that the permit was not “fatally flawed” under the methodology implemented. Titan Tire of Natchez, Inc. v. Miss. Comm'n on Envtl. Quality, 891 So. 2d 195, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 1408 (Miss. 2004).

       § 49-17-44.1.
    Petition for appointment of receiver to operate and manage abandoned or grossly mismanaged sewer systems.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      If the commission determines that any privately owned sewer system that is certificated by the Public Service Commission and within its jurisdiction has been actually or effectively abandoned by its owner, or that its management is grossly inefficient or irresponsible, and the abandonment or management has created an environmental problem that endangers public health, the commission may petition the chancery court of any county wherein the privately-owned sewer system is located for an order attaching the assets of the privately-owned sewer system and placing such sewer system under the sole control and responsibility of a receiver. Any person served by the sewer system shall have standing to intervene in the chancery proceeding as an interested party. If the court determines that the petition is proper in all respects and finds, after a hearing thereon, the allegations contained in the petition are true, it shall order that the sewer system be placed in receivership. The court, in its discretion and in consideration of the recommendation of the commission, may appoint a receiver who shall be a responsible individual, partnership, corporation or political subdivision knowledgeable in sewer service affairs and who shall maintain control and responsibility for the operation and management of the affairs of such sewer system. The receiver shall operate the sewer system so as to preserve the assets of the sewer system and to serve the best interests of its customers while protecting public health and welfare and the environment. The receiver shall be compensated from the assets of the sewer system in an amount to be determined by the court. Control of and responsibility for the sewer system shall remain in the receiver until the court determines that it is in the best interests of the customers and the public interest that the sewer system be returned to the owner, transferred to another owner, or assumed by another sewer system or public service corporation. If the court, after hearing, determines that control of and responsibility for the affairs of the sewer system should not be returned to the legal owner thereof, the receiver may proceed to liquidate the assets of the sewer system in the manner provided by law. Mississippi laws and Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure generally applicable to receivership shall govern receiverships created under this section. Any new owner or operator of a sewer system transferred or liquidated by the receiver or the chancery court under this subsection shall obtain all necessary permits and approvals from the Permit Board, the Public Service Commission and any other applicable state or local agencies.

    Water pollution abatement loan program established; water pollution abatement bond and loan funds.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      There is hereby created for the State of Mississippi a Water Pollution Abatement Loan Program (“program”) from which shall be made loans in aid of construction. Funds shall be available to any political subdivision legally authorized to own, maintain and operate a sewage, industrial waste or other waste collection, transport, treatment and disposal system. No recipient shall receive from state funds any loan in excess of twenty-five percent (25%) of the cost of construction of a project, unless said recipient shall become eligible on or after October 1, 1988, as set forth in Section 49-17-85(3).
     </p>
     <p>
      Such cost of construction includes: preliminary planning to determine the economic and engineering feasibility of treatment works, the engineering, architectural, legal, fiscal and economic investigations and studies, surveys, designs, plans, working drawings, specifications, procedures, and other action necessary to the construction of treatment works; and the erection, building, acquisition, alteration, remodeling, improvement or extension of treatment works; and the inspection and supervision of the construction of treatment works.
     </p>
     <p>
      No loan shall be made for any project under the provisions of Sections 49-17-61 through 49-17-67 unless such project is in conformity with the State Water Pollution Control Plan and has been certified by the Mississippi Commission on Natural Resources as entitled to priority over eligible projects on the basis of financial as well as water pollution control needs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Loan funds generated by the issuance of bonds, legislative appropriations or otherwise, shall be deposited in an appropriate account or accounts created under the program.
     </p>
     <p>
      There is hereby established a special fund designated as the Water Pollution Abatement Bond Fund (“bond fund”), which fund shall be maintained as a separate account in the State Treasury. All bonds which shall be issued by the State of Mississippi to generate funds to be used for loans under this section shall be payable as to principal, interest, premiums, if any, and service fees from the funds deposited in the bond fund. The bond fund hereby established shall be identical to and be a continuation of the Water Pollution Abatement Bond Fund authorized and established by the provisions of Chapter 471, General Laws of the State of Mississippi, 1971.
     </p>
     <p>
      No funds heretofore deposited under any other laws to the credit of a special fund heretofore maintained in the State Treasury, and heretofore designated under such laws as the Water Pollution Abatement Bond Fund, shall be removed or transferred from such Water Pollution Abatement Bond Fund so maintained and designated under any other laws, except as shall be specifically authorized by law. When such removal or transfer shall be authorized, funds removed or transferred shall be deposited to the credit of a special fund hereby established and designated as the Water Pollution Abatement Loan Fund (“loan fund”), which fund shall be maintained as a separate account in the State Treasury.
     </p>
     <p>
      Funds on deposit in the loan fund (a) may be used to make loans in aid of construction for water pollution abatement upon appropriation by the Legislature; (b) in the discretion of the commission, may be transferred to the Water Pollution Control Revolving Fund for the purpose of matching federal capitalization grants and for allowable uses; and (c) may be used for administration of the State Revolving Loan Program subject to legislative appropriation.

   In reviewing an order by the Mississippi Commission on Environmental Quality (Commission) requiring a county board of supervisors to bring its sanitary landfill into compliance with the closure requirements of the Mississippi Nonhazardous Waste Regulations and imposing a $4000 penalty, a chancellor exceeded the limited scope of review for agency decisions where the chancellor affirmed the Commission’s order but modified it by ordering that the penalty be deposited into a separate fund to be spent curing the violations, instead of being paid into the Pollution Emergency Fund as provided by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t49c17s49-17-68" target="_self">49-17-68</a></cite>, and that any funds remaining after closure be returned to the general fund of the county; a penalty should be assessed under the same standard of review as is employed when reviewing other agency findings and actions, and therefore the chancellor had no authority to substitute his own judgment for that of the agency by replacing the penalty with one he felt was more suited to the circumstances.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The governor, on behalf of this state, is hereby authorized to execute a compact, in substantially the following form, with any one or more of the States of Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia, and the legislature hereby signifies in advance its approval and ratification of such compact:
     </p>
     <p>
      Article I
     </p>
     <p>
      The purpose of this compact is to promote effective control and reduction of pollution in the waters of the Tennessee River Basin through increased co-operation of the states of the basin, co-ordination of pollution control activities and programs in the basin, and the establishment of a joint interstate commission to assist in these efforts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article II
     </p>
     <p>
      The party states hereby create the “Tennessee River Basin Water Pollution Control Commission,” hereinafter referred to as the “commission,” which shall be an agency of each party state with the powers and duties set forth herein, and such others as shall be conferred upon it by the party states or by the Congress of the United States concurred in by the party states.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article III
     </p>
     <p>
      A. The party states hereby create the “Tennessee River Basin Water Pollution Control District,” hereinafter called the “district,” which consists of the area drained by the Tennessee River and its tributaries.
     </p>
     <p>
      B. From time to time the commission may conduct surveys of the basin, study the pollution problems of the basin, and make comprehensive reports concerning the prevention or reduction of water pollution therein. The commission may draft and recommend to the parties hereto suggested legislation dealing with the pollution of waters within the basin or any portion thereof. Upon request of a state water pollution control agency, and in a manner agreed upon by such agency and the commission, the commission shall render advice concerning the various governments, communities, municipalities, persons, corporations or other entities with regard to particular problems connected with the pollution of waters. The commission shall present to the appropriate officials of any government or agency thereof its recommendations relating to enactments to be made by any legislature in furthering the intents and purposes of this article. The commission, upon request of a member state or upon its own instance may, after proper study, and after conducting public hearings, recommend minimum standards of water quality to be followed in the several areas of the district.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article IV
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission shall consist of three (3) commissioners from each state, each of whom shall be a resident voter of such state. The commissioners shall be chosen in the manner and for the terms provided by the laws of the state from which they are appointed, and each commissioner may be removed or suspended from office as provided by the law of the state from which he is appointed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article V
     </p>
     <p>
      A. The commission shall elect annually from its members a chairman and a vice-chairman to serve at its pleasure. It shall adopt a seal and suitable by-laws for its management and control. The commission is hereby authorized to adopt, prescribe and promulgate rules and regulations for administering and enforcing all provisions of this compact. It may maintain one or more offices for the transaction of its business. Meetings shall be held at least once each year. It may determine duties, qualifications and compensation for and appoint such employees and consultants as may be necessary and remove or replace them.
     </p>
     <p>
      B. The commission shall not compensate the commissioners for their services but shall pay their actual expenses incurred in and incidental to the performance of their duties.
     </p>
     <p>
      C. The commission may acquire, by gift or otherwise, and may hold and dispose of such real and personal property as may be appropriate to the performance of its functions. In the event of sale of real property, proceeds may be distributed among the several party states, each state’s share being computed in a ratio to its contributions; and in the event of dissolution of the commission, the property and assets shall be disposed of and proceeds distributed in a like manner.
     </p>
     <p>
      D. Each commissioner shall have one vote. One or more commissioners from a majority of the party states shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, but no action of the commission imposing any obligation on any party state or any municipality, person, corporation or other entity therein shall be binding unless a majority of all of the members from such party state shall have voted in favor thereof. The commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements, and shall submit to the governor and the legislature of each party state an annual report concerning its activities, and shall make recommendations for any legislative, executive or administrative action deemed advisable.
     </p>
     <p>
      E. The commission shall at the proper time submit to the governor of each party state for his approval an estimate of its proposed expenditures. The commission shall subsequently adopt a budget and submit appropriation requests to the party states in accordance with the laws and procedures of such states.
     </p>
     <p>
      F. The commission shall not pledge the credit of any of the party states. The Commission may meet any of its obligations in whole or in part with funds available to it, from gifts, grants, appropriations or otherwise, provided that the commission takes specific action setting aside such funds prior to the incurring of any obligation to be met in whole or in part in this manner. Except where the commission makes use of funds already available to it, the commission shall not incur any obligations prior to the making of appropriations adequate to meet the same.
     </p>
     <p>
      G. The accounts of the commission shall be open at any reasonable time to the inspection of such representatives of the respective party states as may be duly constituted for that purpose. All receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the commission shall be audited yearly by a qualified public accountant, and the report of the audit shall be included in and become a part of the annual report of the commission. The commission shall appoint an executive director. The commission shall also appoint a treasurer who may be a member of the commission. The executive director shall be custodian of the records of the commission with authority to attest to and certify such records and copies thereof under the seal of the commission. The commission shall require bonds of its executive director and treasurer in the amount of at least twenty-five per cent (25%) of the annual budget of the commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article VI
     </p>
     <p>
      Each of the commission’s budgets of estimated expenditures shall contain specific recommendations of the amount or amounts to be appropriated by each of the party states. In determining these amounts, the commission shall prorate one half (1/2) of its budget among the several states in proportion to their land area within the district, and shall prorate the other half among the several states in proportion to their population within the district at the last preceding federal census.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article VII
     </p>
     <p>
      A. It is recognized, owing to such variable factors as location, size, character and flow and the many varied uses of the waters subject to the terms of this compact, that no single standard of sewage and waste treatment and no single standard of quality of receiving waters is practical and that the degree of treatment of sewage and industrial wastes should take into account the classification of the receiving waters according to present and proposed highest use, such as for drinking water supply, industrial and agricultural uses, bathing and other recreational purposes, maintenance and propagation of fish life, navigation and disposal of wastes.
     </p>
     <p>
      B. The commission may establish reasonable physical, chemical and bacteriological standards of water quality satisfactory for various classifications of use. It is agreed that each of the signatory states through appropriate agencies will prepare a classification of its interstate waters in the district in entirety or by portions according to present and proposed highest use, and for this purpose technical experts employed by appropriate state water pollution control agencies are authorized to confer on questions relating to classification of interstate waters affecting two or more states. Each signatory state agrees to submit its classification of its interstate waters to the commission for approval. It is agreed that after such approval, all signatory states through their appropriate state water pollution control agencies will work to establish programs of treatment of sewage and industrial wastes which will meet standards established by the commission for classified waters. The commission may from time to time make such changes in definitions of classifications and in standards as may be required by changed conditions or as may be necessary for uniformity and in a manner similar to that in which these standards and classifications were originally established.
     </p>

      Article VIII
     </p>
     <p>
      A. A state pollution control agency of any party state may certify to the commission an alleged violation of the commission’s standards of quality of water entering said state. Upon such certification the commission may call a hearing at which the appropriate state pollution agencies shall be represented. If the commission finds a violation has occurred, is occurring or is likely to recur, it shall make recommendations as to the manner of abatement of the pollution to the appropriate water pollution control agency of the party state within which the violation has occurred, is occurring or is likely to recur. In the event that commission recommendations made pursuant to the preceding provisions of this article do not result in compliance within a reasonable time, the commission may, after such further investigation if any as is deemed necessary and proper and after a hearing held in the state where a violation occurs or has occurred, issue an order or orders upon any municipality, person, corporation or other entity within said party state violating provisions of this compact by discharging sewage or industrial wastes into the waters of the district which flow through, into or border upon any party state. Such order or orders may prescribe the date on or before which such discharge shall be wholly or partially discontinued, modified or treated or otherwise disposed of. The commission shall give reasonable and proper notice in writing of the time and place of the hearing to the municipality, person, corporation or other entity against which such order is proposed except that when the commission shall find that a public health emergency exists, it may issue such an order pending hearing. In all such instances, the hearing shall be promptly held and the order shall be withdrawn, modified or made permanent within thirty (30) days after hearing. No order prescribing the date on or before which such discharge shall be wholly or partially discontinued, modified or treated or otherwise disposed of shall go into effect upon a municipality, person, corporation or other entity in any state unless and until it receives the approval of a majority of the commissioners from each of not less than a majority of the party states, provided that such order receives the assent of not less than a majority of the commissioners from such state.
     </p>
     <p>
      B. It shall be the duty of the municipality, person, corporation or other entity within a party state to comply with any such order against it or him by the commission, and any court of competent jurisdiction in any of the party states shall have jurisdiction, by mandamus, injunction, specific performance or other form of remedy, to enforce any such order against any municipality, person, corporation or other entity domiciled, located or doing business within such state; provided, however, such court may review the order and affirm, reverse or modify the same in any appropriate proceeding brought and upon any of the grounds customarily applicable in proceedings for court review of administrative decisions. The commission or, at its request, the attorney general or other law enforcing official of the appropriate state shall have power to institute in such court any action for the enforcement of such order.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article IX
     </p>
     <p>
      Nothing in this compact shall be construed to limit the powers of any party state, or to repeal or prevent the enactment of any legislation, or the enforcement of any requirement by any party state, imposing any additional conditions and restrictions to further reduce or prevent the pollution of waters within its jurisdiction.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article X
     </p>
     <p>
      A. Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed so as to conflict with any provision of the Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation Compact or to impose obligations on any party state inconsistent with those which it has undertaken or may undertake by virtue of its membership in said compact; provided that nothing contained in this article shall be deemed to limit the commission’s power to set higher standards for the waters of the Tennessee River Basin Water Pollution Control District or any portion thereof than those required for the Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation District.
     </p>
     <p>
      B. Nothing contained in this compact shall be deemed to give the commission any power or jurisdiction over any aspect of pollution abatement or control within the district unless existing or future pollution of such waters does or is likely to affect adversely the quality of water flowing among, between, into or through the territory of more than one party state.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article XI
     </p>
     <p>
      Any two (2) or more of the party states by legislative action may enter into supplementary agreements for further regulation and abatement of water pollution in other areas within the party states and for the establishment of common or joint services or facilities for such purpose and designate the commission to act as their joint agency in regard thereto. Except in those cases where all member states join in such supplementary agreement and designation, the representatives in the commission of any group of such designating states shall constitute a separate section of the commission for the performance of the function or functions so designated and with such voting rights for these purposes as may be stipulated in such agreement; provided that, if any additional expense is involved, the member states so acting shall appropriate the necessary funds for this purpose. No supplementary agreement shall be valid to the extent that it conflicts with the purposes of this compact and the creation of such a section as a joint agency shall not affect the privileges, powers, responsibilities or duties of the member states participating therein as embodied in the other articles of this compact.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article XII
     </p>
     <p>
      This compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding when it has been enacted by the legislature of Tennessee and by the legislatures of any one or more of the states of Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina and Virginia and upon approval by the Congress of the United States and thereafter shall enter into force and become effective and binding as to any other of said states when enacted by the legislature thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article XIII
     </p>
     <p>
      This compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each party state until renounced by act of the legislature of such state, in such form and manner as it may choose; provided that such renunciation shall not become effective until six (6) months after the effective date of the action taken by the legislature. Notice of such renunciation shall be given to the other party states by the secretary of state of the party state so renouncing upon passage of the act.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article XIV
     </p>
     <p>
      The provisions of this compact or of agreements thereunder shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact, or such agreement, is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any state, agency, person or circumstances is held invalid, the constitutionality of the remainder of this compact or of any agreement thereunder and the applicability thereof to any state, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby, provided further that if this compact or any agreement thereunder shall be held contrary to the Constitution of the United States or of any state participating therein, the compact or any agreement thereunder shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters. It is the legislative intent that the provisions of this compact shall be reasonably and liberally construed.

     <p>
      All bonds issued by a municipality under authority of Sections 49-17-101 through 49-17-123 shall be limited obligations of such municipality. The principal, interest and redemption premium, if any, shall be payable solely out of the moneys to be derived by the municipality pursuant to the agreements specified in subsections (d) and (e) of Section 49-17-103. Bonds and interest coupons issued under authority of Sections 49-17-101 through 49-17-123 shall never constitute an indebtedness of such municipality within the meaning of any state constitutional provision or statutory limitation and shall never constitute nor give rise to a pecuniary liability of the municipality, or a charge against its general credit or taxing powers, and such fact shall be plainly stated on the face of each bond. Such bonds may be executed and delivered at any time as a single issue or from time to time as several issues, may be in such form and denominations, may be of such tenor, may be in registered or bearer form either as to principal or interest or both, may be payable in such installments and at such time or times not exceeding forty (40) years from their date, may be subject to such terms of redemption, may be payable at such place or places, may bear interest at such rate or rates as the governing board and the industry shall agree upon, provided that the bonds of any issue shall not bear a greater overall maximum interest rate to maturity than that allowed in Section 75-17-103; and may contain such other provisions not inconsistent herewith, as the municipality may determine, all of which shall be provided in the proceedings authorizing the bonds. Any bonds issued under the authority of Sections 49-17-101 through 49-17-123 may be sold at public or private sale at such price and in such manner and from time to time as may be determined by the governing board to be most advantageous, and the governing board may pay, as a part of the cost of acquiring any pollution control facility, and out of the bond proceeds, all expenses, premiums and commissions with the authorization, sale and issuance thereof. All bonds issued under the authority of Sections 49-17-101 through 49-17-123, except registered bonds which are registered otherwise than to bearer, and all interest coupons appurtenant thereto shall be construed to be negotiable instruments, despite the fact that they are payable solely from a specified source. The proceedings authorizing the issuance of bonds may provide for the issuance, in the future, of further bonds on a parity with those initially issued.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bonds issued hereunder shall be validated in the chancery court in which the municipality is located.

    Securing payment of bonds.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The principal, interest and premium, if any, on any bonds shall be secured by a pledge of the revenues payable to the municipality, as the case may be, pursuant to either of the agreements specified in subsections (d) and (e) of Section 49-17-103 and may also, in the case of an agreement under subsection (e) of Section 49-17-103, be secured by a lien which may be subordinate to a prior lien on any other property given as security by the industry pursuant to the lease/sale and any bonds may be issued pursuant to and secured by a trust indenture. The proceedings under which bonds are authorized to be issued or any such trust indenture may contain any agreements and provisions customarily contained in instruments securing bonds, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, provisions respecting the fixing and collection of the sums payable by the industry to the municipality and/or the trustee, if any, as the case may be, pursuant to the lease/sale, the maintenance and insurance of the pollution control facilities, the creation and maintenance of special funds by the industry, and the rights and remedies available in the event of default to the bondholders or to the trustee under such trust indenture, all as the governing board shall deem advisable. Provided, however, that in making any such agreements or provisions no municipality shall have the power to obligate itself except with respect to any security pledged, mortgaged or otherwise made available by the industry for the securing of the bonds, and the application of the revenues from the agreement, made under either subsections (d) or (e) of Section 49-17-103 and shall not have the power to incur a pecuniary liability or a charge upon its general credit or against its taxing powers. The proceedings authorizing any bonds hereunder and any trust indenture securing such bonds may provide that in the event of default in payment of the principal of or the interest on such bonds or in the performance of any agreement contained in such proceedings or trust indenture, such payment and performance may be enforced by mandamus or by the appointment of a receiver in equity with such powers as may be necessary to enforce the obligations thereof. No breach of any such agreement shall impose any pecuniary liability upon any municipality, or any charge upon its general credit or against its taxing power.
     </p>
     <p>
      The trustee or trustees under any trust indenture, or any depository specified by such trust indenture, may be such persons or corporations as the governing board shall designate, notwithstanding that they may be nonresidents of Mississippi or incorporated under the laws of the United States or the laws of other states of the United States.

       § 49-17-108.
    Refunding bonds.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any bonds issued under authority of Sections 49-17-101 through 49-17-123, and at any time outstanding, may, at any time and from time to time, be refunded by a municipality by the issuance of its refunding bonds in such amount as the governing board may deem necessary, but not to exceed in the aggregate the sum of (a) the principal amount of the obligations to be refunded, (b) applicable redemption premiums thereon, (c) unpaid interest on such obligations to be refunded to the date of delivery or exchange of the refunding bonds, (d) in the event the proceeds from the sale of the refunding bonds are to be deposited in trust as hereinafter provided, interest to accrue on such obligations to be refunded from the date of delivery of the refunding bonds to the date of maturity of such obligations to be refunded, or to the first redemption date of such obligations to be refunded, whichever shall be earlier, and (e) expenses, premiums and commissions deemed by the governing board to be necessary in connection with the issuance of the refunding bonds.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any such refunding may be effected whether the obligations to be refunded shall have then matured or shall thereafter mature, either by the exchange of the refunding bonds for the obligations to be refunded thereby or by sale of the refunding bonds and the application of the proceeds thereof to the payment of the obligations to be refunded thereby, provided that the holders of any bonds so to be refunded shall not be compelled without their consent to surrender their bonds for payment or exchange prior to the date on which they are payable or, if they are called for redemption, prior to the date on which they are, by their terms, subject to redemption, and regardless of whether or not the obligations to be refunded were issued in connection with the same projects or separate projects, and regardless of whether or not the obligations to be refunded shall be payable on the same date or different dates or shall be due serially or otherwise. Any refunding bonds issued under the authority of this section shall be payable from the revenues out of which the bonds to be refunded hereby were payable and shall be secured in accordance with the provisions of Section 49-17-107 and as authorized by this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      The principal proceeds from the sale of any refunding bonds shall be applied to the payment of any expenses, premiums and commissions incurred in connection with such refunding and as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      To the immediate payment and retirement of the obligations being refunded; or
     </p>
     <p>
      Deposited in trust to provide for the payment and retirement of the obligations being refunded, including the interest thereon, and to pay interest on the refunding bonds prior to the retirement of the obligations being refunded. Money in any such trust fund may be invested in direct obligations of, or obligations the principal of and interest on which are guaranteed by, the United States of America, or obligations of any agency or instrumentality of the United States Government, or in certificates of deposit issued by a bank or trust company located in the State of Mississippi, if such certificates shall be secured by a pledge of any of said obligations having an aggregate market value equal to one hundred twenty percent (120%) of the principal amount of the certificates so secured. Nothing herein shall be construed as a limitation on the duration of any deposit in trust for the retirement of obligations being refunded, but which shall not have matured and which shall not be presently redeemable.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prior to the issuance of refunding bonds under this section no findings shall be required of the pollution authority under Section 49-17-111. In lieu of the petition required by Section 49-17-121, the governing board shall file with the board a petition giving a brief explanation of the proposal to refund the obligations sought to be refunded, and financial statements on the company obligated under the lease/sale. Upon the filing of the petition, the board shall, as soon as practicable, approve the issuance of such refunding bonds, unless it determines that the issuance of such bonds would not be consistent with the purposes of Sections 49-17-101 through 49-17-123; and at any time not exceeding six (6) years following such approval the governing board may proceed with the issuance of such refunding bonds. The refunding bonds issued pursuant to this section shall be subject to all other terms and conditions of Sections 49-17-101 through 49-17-123, except for those provisions which, by their terms, do not apply to such refunding bonds.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is the intent of the legislature that the terms used in this section shall have the meanings set forth in Section 49-17-101.

      Contracts for acquisition, purchase, construction and/or installation of facilities contemplated by Sections 49-17-101 through 49-17-123 shall be effected in the manner prescribed by law for public contracts; provided, however, where (a) the municipality finds and records such finding on its minutes, that because of availability or particular nature of such facilities, it would not be in the public interest or would less effectively achieve the purposes of Sections 49-17-101 through 49-17-123 to enter into such contracts upon the basis of public bidding pursuant to advertisement, (b) the industry concurs in such finding, and (c) such finding is approved by the board, public bidding pursuant to advertisement may be dispensed with and such contracts may be entered into based upon negotiation; and provided further, the industry at its option, may negotiate such contracts in the name of the municipality.

      No bonds shall be issued pursuant to the provisions of Sections 49-17-101 through 49-17-123 until the proposal of the governing board to issue the bonds shall receive the approval of the board. Whenever the governing board shall propose to issue bonds pursuant to the provisions of said sections, it shall file its petition to the board setting forth: (a) a brief description of the pollution control facilities proposed to be undertaken; (b) a statement setting forth the action taken by the pollution control authority in connection with the pollution control facilities; (c) a reasonable estimate of the cost of the pollution control facilities; (d) a general summary of the terms and conditions of the lease/sale; and (e) financial statements on lessee company. Upon the filing of the petition the board shall, as soon as practicable, make such investigation as it deems advisable, and if it finds that the proposed pollution control facilities are intended to promote the purposes of Sections 49-17-101 through 49-17-123 and may be reasonably anticipated to effect such result, it shall be authorized to approve the pollution control facilities, and at any time not exceeding six (6) years following such approval, the governing board may proceed with the issuance of bonds for the pollution control facilities. Notice of the approval by the board shall be published at least once by the governing board in a newspaper having general circulation in the county where the pollution control facilities are to be located. The governing board shall thereupon adopt and publish as required by law a resolution declaring its intention to issue said bonds.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The commission is authorized to establish requirements for the written reporting of motor fuel contamination incidents from underground storage tanks. All sites involving incidents of motor fuel contamination from underground storage tanks, where the owner of such tanks is in substantial compliance and files a written report with the commission of such incident, shall be qualified sites for the expenditure of funds from the Mississippi Groundwater Protection Trust Fund created by Sections 49-17-401 through 49-17-433. Any funds so expended shall be absorbed at the expense of the fund, without recourse to reimbursement or recovery from any underground storage tank owner, subject to the following exceptions:
     </p>
     <p>
      The provisions of this section shall not apply to any site where the department has initiated any cleanup or civil enforcement action prior to the passage of Sections 49-17-401 through 49-17-433.
     </p>
     <p>
      The provisions of this section shall not apply to any site where the department has been denied site access to implement the provisions of Sections 49-17-401 through 49-17-433.
     </p>
     <p>
      The provisions of this section shall not be construed to authorize or require reimbursement from the fund for costs expended prior to the passage of Sections 49-17-401 through 49-17-433.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission may determine, in its discretion, that the owner of an underground storage tank is not in substantial compliance for the purposes of this section and Section 49-17-405, if such owner of an underground storage tank has been delinquent in the payment of tank regulatory fees for more than three (3) months after such fee is due and payable.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any provisions of this section and chapter regarding liability for the costs of clean-up, removal, remediation or abatement of any pollution, hazardous waste or solid waste shall be limited as provided in Section 49-17-42 and rules adopted thereto.

      <p>
       The 2018 amendment added (2), and divided the former section into (1) and the last two paragraphs of (2); in (1), rewrote the former first two sentences, which read: “The commission may assess and collect a tank regulatory fee in an amount sufficient to administer Sections 49-17-401 through 49-17-435 but not to exceed One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) per tank per year from the owner of each underground storage tank in use in Mississippi on July 1, 1988, or brought into use after that date, as provided in the Mississippi Underground Storage Tank Act of 1988 (Sections 49-17-401 through 49-17-435). The tank regulatory fee assessed under this section is a debt due by the owner of each underground storage tank in use in Mississippi on July 1, 1988, or brought into use after that date”; and in the third paragraph of (2), combined the former first two sentences into the first sentence, and therein deleted “tank regulatory” preceding “fee is not paid.”

   A county utility authority may not force a municipal utility to execute a service agreement which provides that if the city does not comply with the authority’s rules and regulations, the authority will take over the water and wastewater connections within the city under the Mississippi Gulf Coast Regional Utility Authority Act, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t49c17s49-17-701" target="_self">49-17-701</a></cite>, et seq. Taylor, February 2, 2007, A.G. Op. #06-00675, 2007 Miss. AG LEXIS 10.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the Mississippi Gulf Coast Regional Utility Act expressly applies only to utility systems which are “connected with, or tied into” the systems of a county authority, the determination as to whether a system is covered by the Act is best left to the county authorities, and the Department of Health may not expand the Act to include other systems. Amy, March 30, 2007, A.G. Op. #07-00139, 2007 Miss. AG LEXIS 70.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Department of Health’s current policy of first seeking direction from the county authority before proceeding with approval or renewal of a water, wastewater or storm water system is consistent with, and satisfies the Department’s duties under the Mississippi Gulf Coast Regional Utility Act and other state laws.

     </h3>
     <p>
      In the spirit of the report of the Governor’s Commission on Recovery, Rebuilding and Renewal, the Legislature finds that there is a need for consolidation of water, wastewater and storm water services in order to reduce costs, promote resilience in the event of a disaster, improve the quality of the natural environment, and improve the planning and delivery of quality water, wastewater and storm water services within the areas of the Counties of George, Hancock, Harrison, Jackson, Pearl River and Stone. It is further declared that there is the need for the planning, acquisition, construction, maintenance, operation and coordination of water, wastewater and storm water services in order to ensure protection of the waters of the state and to ensure the delivery of water, wastewater and storm water services to citizens of the Gulf Coast Region. The creation of the Mississippi Gulf Coast Region Utility Act is determined to be necessary and essential to the accomplishment of these purposes. To facilitate the purposes of the act, the Gulf Coast Region Utility Board, the George County Utility Authority, the Hancock County Utility Authority, the Harrison County Utility Authority, the Jackson County Utility Authority, the Pearl River County Utility Authority and the Stone County Utility Authority are created herein.

Such rates, fees, assessments and any other charges shall not be subject to the jurisdiction of the Mississippi Public Service Commission;

     </p>
     <p>
      The county authority shall have the power of eminent domain for the particular purpose of the acquisition of property designated by plan to sufficiently accommodate the location of water, wastewater or storm water systems and such requirements related directly thereto pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 27, Title 11, Mississippi Code of 1972.

Frierson, Oct. 6, 2006, A.G. Op. 06-0465.

       A review of the language in Section 49-17-745 reveals no authority for a county utility authority to impose its jurisdiction upon rural utility districts which are not connected with the county authority. Ellington, Nov. 10, 2006, A.G. Op. 06-0556.

       No specific authority can be found for a county utility authority to require persons living in a public service commission certificated area to “tie into” the system operated by the public service commission franchisee. Heidelberg, Nov. 17, 2006, A.G. Op. 06-0555.

   A county utility authority may not force a municipal utility to execute a service agreement which provides that if the city does not comply with the authority’s rules and regulations, the authority will take over the water and wastewater connections within the city under the Mississippi Gulf Coast Regional Utility Authority Act, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t49c17s49-17-701" target="_self">49-17-701</a></cite>, et seq. Taylor, February 2, 2007, A.G. Op. #06-00675, 2007 Miss. AG LEXIS 10.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the Mississippi Gulf Coast Regional Utility Act expressly applies only to utility systems which are “connected with, or tied into” the systems of a county authority, the determination as to whether a system is covered by the Act is best left to the county authorities, and the Department of Health may not expand the Act to include other systems. Amy, March 30, 2007, A.G. Op. #07-00139, 2007 Miss. AG LEXIS 70.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Department of Health’s current policy of first seeking direction from the county authority before proceeding with approval or renewal of a water, wastewater or storm water system is consistent with, and satisfies the Department’s duties under the Mississippi Gulf Coast Regional Utility Act and other state laws. Amy, March 30, 2007, A.G. Op. #07-00139, 2007 Miss. AG LEXIS 70.

The validity of the bonds so validated and of the contracts and payments to be made by the public agencies thereunder constituting security for the bonds shall be forever conclusive against the county authority and the public agencies which are parties to said contracts; and the validity of said bonds and said contracts and the payments to be made thereunder shall never be called in question in any court in this state.

       Because the Mississippi Gulf Coast Regional Utility Act expressly applies only to utility systems which are “connected with, or tied into” the systems of a county authority, the determination as to whether a system is covered by the Act is best left to the county authorities, and the Department of Health may not expand the Act to include other systems.

       The Department of Health’s current policy of first seeking direction from the county authority before proceeding with approval or renewal of a water, wastewater or storm water system is consistent with, and satisfies the Department’s duties under the Mississippi Gulf Coast Regional Utility Act and other state laws.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The duties and powers of the commission shall be:
     </p>
     <p>
      To appoint a State Forester, who shall serve at the will and pleasure of the commission and who is qualified to perform the duties as set forth herein; and to pay him such salary as is provided by the Legislature, and allow him such office expenses incidental to the performance of his official duties as the commission, in its discretion, may deem necessary; and to charge him with the immediate direction and control, subject to the supervision and approval of the commission, of all matters relating to forestry as authorized herein. Any person appointed by the commission as State Forester shall have received a bachelor’s degree in forestry from an accredited school or college of forestry and shall be licensed and registered under the provisions of the Mississippi Foresters Registration Law (Section 73-36-1 et seq.) and in addition shall have had at least five (5) years’ administrative experience in a forestry-related field.
     </p>
     <p>
      To take such action and provide and maintain such organized means as may seem necessary and expedient to prevent, control and extinguish forest fires, including the enforcement of any and all laws pertaining to the protection of forests and woodland.
     </p>
     <p>
      To encourage forest and tree planting for the production of a wood crop, for the protection of water supply, for windbreak and shade, or for any other beneficial purposes contributing to the general welfare, public hygiene and comfort of the people.
     </p>
     <p>
      To cause to be made such technical investigations and studies concerning forest conditions, the propagation, care and protection of forest and shade trees, the care and management of forests, their growth, yield and the products and by-products thereof, and any other competent subject, including forest taxation, bearing on the timber supply and needs of the state, which the commission, in its discretion, may deem proper.
     </p>
     <p>
      To assist and cooperate with any federal or state department or institution, county, town, corporation or individual, under such terms as in the judgment of the commission will best serve the public interest, in the preparation and execution of plans for the protection, management, replacement, or extension of the forest, woodland and roadside or other ornamental tree growth in the state.
     </p>
     <p>
      To encourage public interest in forestry by means of correspondence, the public press, periodicals, the publication of bulletins and leaflets for general distribution, the delivery of lectures in the schools and other suitable means, and to cooperate to the fullest extent with the extension department services of the state colleges in promoting reforestation. It shall be the duty of the State Forester to cooperate with private timber owners in laying plans for the protection, management and replacement of forests and in aiding them to form protection associations. It shall be his duty to examine all timbered lands belonging to the state and its institutions and report to the commission upon their timber conditions and actual value, and also whether some of these lands may not be held as state forests. He shall be responsible for the protection and management of lands donated, purchased or belonging to the state or state institutions, and all other lands reserved by the state as state forests.
     </p>
     <p>
      To control the expenditure of any and all funds appropriated or otherwise made available for the several purposes set forth herein under suitable regulations and restrictions by the commission and to specifically authorize any officer or employee of the commission to incur necessary and stipulated expenses in connection with the work in which such person may be engaged.
     </p>
     <p>
      To submit annually to the Legislature a report of the expenditures, proceedings and results achieved, together with such other matters including recommendations concerning legislation as are germane to the aims and purposes of this chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      To create, establish and organize the State of Mississippi into forestry districts for the most effective and efficient administration of the commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      To appoint, upon the State Forester’s recommendation, six (6) individuals who shall be designated Mississippi Forestry Commission Law Enforcement Officers with authority to bear arms, investigate and make arrests; however, the law enforcement duties and authority of the officers shall be limited to woods arson. The officers shall comply with applicable minimum educational and training standards for law enforcement officers. These officers may issue citations for any violation of those laws for recklessly or with gross negligence causing fire to burn the lands of another. A citation issued by a Forestry Commission law enforcement officer shall be issued on a uniform citation form consisting of an original and at least two (2) copies. Such citation shall show, among other necessary information, the name of the issuing officer, the name of the court in which the cause is to be heard and the date and time the person charged with a violation is to appear to answer the charge. The uniform citation form shall make a provision on it for information that will constitute a complaint charging the offense for which the citation was issued and, when duly sworn to and filed with a court of competent jurisdiction, prosecution may proceed under that complaint. For the purposes of this paragraph, the fact that any person is found to have a brush or debris pile or other material which is or was being burned and reasonable and prudent efforts were not taken to prevent the spread of the fire onto the lands of another shall be evidence that such person recklessly or with gross negligence caused the land to burn.
     </p>
     <p>
      This paragraph shall stand repealed on June 30, 2022.

       The appearance before a grand jury which returned an indictment under this section of an employee of the state forestry commission who had investigated an allegedly incendiary forest fire but who had no personal knowledge of the facts was not an improper influence on the grand jury.

       The fact that a forestry commission employee, who investigated a forest fire talked to the witnesses but had no personal knowledge of the facts, testified before the grand jury that he brought the case up in justice of the peace court and had the witnesses there for the preliminary hearing, did not place him in the category of a special prosecutor employed to assist with the prosecution, and hence his appearance before the grand jury was not an improper influence. Case v. State, 220 So. 2d 289, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1447 (Miss. 1969).

      Any fire on any forested, cutover, brush lands or grass lands burning uncontrolled is hereby declared a public nuisance by reason of its menace to life and property. Any person, firm or corporation negligently or wilfully and maliciously responsible for the starting or the existence of such fire on land other than his own is hereby required to control or extinguish it immediately, and if said person, firm or corporation shall wilfully refuse, neglect or fail to do so, any organized fire suppression agency recognized by the Mississippi Forestry Commission, may summarily abate the nuisance thus constituted by controlling or extinguishing the fire. The cost of abating such nuisance, with all costs and reasonable attorney’s fees to be allowed by the court, may be recovered from the person, firm or corporation responsible for such nuisance by civil action in the proper court, action for said recovery to be filed by the agency abating the nuisance. This section shall not impair any remedy now allowed by law.

     <p>
      Any open cistern or well, which has been abandoned or is no longer used for the purpose of a cistern or well is hereby declared to be a public nuisance by reason of its menace to life and property, and the Mississippi Forestry Commission is hereby authorized to seal such cistern or well upon request of the landowner. A reasonable fee shall be charged for this purpose and all fees collected shall be handled in the same manner as other service charges collected by the commissioner.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The governor on behalf of this state is hereby authorized to execute a compact, in substantially the following form, with any one or more of the states of Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas, and the legislature hereby signifies in advance its approval and ratification of such compact:
     </p>
     <p>
      SOUTH CENTRAL INTERSTATE FOREST FIRE PROTECTION COMPACT
     </p>
     <p>
      Article I.
     </p>
     <p>
      The purpose of this compact is to promote effective prevention and control of forest fires in the south central region of the United States by the development of integrated forest fire plans, by the maintenance of adequate forest fire fighting services by the member states, by providing for mutual aid in fighting forest fires among the compacting states of the region and with states which are party to other regional forest fire protection compacts or agreements, and for more adequate forest development.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article II.
     </p>
     <p>
      This compact shall become operative immediately as to those states ratifying it whenever any two (2) or more of the states of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas which are contiguous have ratified it and Congress has given consent thereto. Any state not mentioned in this article which is contiguous with any member state may become a party to this compact, subject to approval by the legislature of each of the member states.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article III.
     </p>
     <p>
      In each state, the state forester or officer holding the equivalent position who is responsible for forest fire control shall act as compact administrator for that state and shall consult with like officials of the other member states and shall implement cooperation between such states in forest fire prevention and control.
     </p>
     <p>
      The compact administrators of the member states shall organize to coordinate the services of the member states and provide administrative integration in carrying out the purposes of this compact.
     </p>
     <p>
      There shall be established an advisory committee of legislators, forestry commission representatives, and forestry or forest products industries representatives which shall meet from time to time with the compact administrators. Each member state shall name one member of the senate and one member of the house of representatives, and the governor of each member state shall appoint one representative who shall be the chairman of the state forestry commission or comparable official and one representative who shall be associated with forestry or forest products industries to comprise the membership of the advisory committee. Action shall be taken by a majority of the compacting states, and each state shall be entitled to one vote.
     </p>
     <p>
      The compact administrators shall formulate and, in accordance with need, from time to time, revise a regional forest fire plan for the member states.
     </p>
     <p>
      It shall be the duty of each member state to formulate and put in effect a forest fire plan for that state and take such measures as may be necessary to integrate such forest fire plan with the regional forest fire plan formulated by the compact administrators.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article IV.
     </p>
     <p>
      Whenever the state forest fire control agency of a member state requests aid from the state forest fire control agency of any other member state in combating, controlling or preventing forest fires, it shall be the duty of the state forest fire control agency of that state to render all possible aid to the requesting agency which is consonant with the maintenance of protection at home.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article V.
     </p>
     <p>
      Whenever the forces of any member state are rendering outside aid pursuant to the request of another member state under this compact, the employees of such state shall, under the direction of the officers of the state to which they are rendering aid, have the same powers (except the power of arrest), duties, rights, privileges and immunities as comparable employees of the state to which they are rendering aid.
     </p>
     <p>
      No member state or its officers or employees rendering outside aid pursuant to this compact shall be liable on account of any act or omission on the part of such forces while so engaged, or on account of the maintenance or use of any equipment or supplies in connection therewith: Provided, that nothing herein shall be construed as relieving any person from liability for his own negligent act or omission, or as imposing liability for such negligent act or omission upon any state.
     </p>
     <p>
      All liability, except as otherwise provided hereinafter, that may arise either under the laws of the requesting state or under the laws of the aiding state or under the laws of a third state on account of or in connection with a request for aid, shall be assumed and borne by the requesting state.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any member state rendering outside aid pursuant to this compact shall be reimbursed by the member state receiving such aid for any loss or damage to, or expense incurred in the operation of any equipment answering a request for aid, and for the cost of all materials, transportation, wages, salaries, and maintenance of employees and equipment incurred in connection with such request: Provided, that nothing herein contained shall prevent any assisting member state from assuming such loss, damage, expense or other cost or from loaning such equipment or from donating such service to the receiving member state without charge or cost.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each member state shall provide for the payment of compensation and death benefits to injured employees and the representatives of deceased employees in case employees sustain injuries or are killed while rendering outside aid pursuant to this compact, in the same manner and on the same terms as if the injury or death were sustained within such state.
     </p>
     <p>
      For the purposes of this compact the term employee shall include any volunteer or auxiliary legally included within the forest fighting forces of the aiding state under the laws thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      The compact administrators shall formulate procedures for claims and reimbursement under the provisions of this article, in accordance with the laws of the member states.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article VI.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ratification of this compact shall not be construed to affect any existing statute so as to authorize or permit curtailment or diminution of the forest fighting forces, equipment, services or facilities of any member state.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nothing in this compact shall be construed to limit or restrict the powers of any state ratifying the same to provide for the prevention, control and extinguishment of forest fires, or to prohibit the enactment or enforcement of state laws, rules or regulations intended to aid in such prevention, control and extinguishment in such state.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nothing in this compact shall be construed to affect any existing or future cooperative relationship or arrangement between the United States Forest Service and a member state or states.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article VII.
     </p>
     <p>
      The compact administrators may request the United States Forest Service to act as the primary research and coordinating agency of the South Central Interstate Forest Fire Protection Compact in cooperation with the appropriate agencies in each state, and the United States Forest Service may accept the initial responsibility in preparing and presenting to the compact administrators its recommendations with respect to the regional fire plan. Representatives of the United States Forest Service may attend meetings of the compact administrators.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article VIII.
     </p>
     <p>
      The provisions of article IV and V of this compact which relate to mutual aid in combating, controlling or preventing forest fires shall be operative as between any state party to this compact and any other state which is party to a regional forest fire protection compact in another region: Provided, that the legislature of such other state shall have given its assent to such mutual aid provisions of this compact.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article IX.
     </p>
     <p>
      This compact shall continue in force and remain binding on each state ratifying it until the legislature or the governor of such state takes action to withdraw therefrom. Such action shall not be effective until six (6) months after notice thereof has been sent by the chief executive of the state desiring to withdraw to the chief executives of all states then parties to the compact.

    Southeastern Interstate Forest Fire Protection Compact authorized.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The governor on behalf of this state is hereby authorized to execute a compact, in substantially the following form, with any one or more of the States of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia, and the legislature hereby signifies in advance its approval and ratification of such compact:
     </p>
     <p>
      SOUTHEASTERN INTERSTATE FOREST FIRE PROTECTION COMPACT
     </p>
     <p>
      Article I.
     </p>
     <p>
      The purpose of this compact is to promote effective prevention and control of forest fires in the southeastern region of the United States by the development of integrated forest fire plans, by the maintenance of adequate forest fire fighting services by the member states, by providing for mutual aid in fighting forest fires among the compacting states of the region and with states which are party to other regional forest fire protection compacts or agreements, and for more adequate forest protection.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article II.
     </p>
     <p>
      This compact shall become operative immediately as to those states ratifying it whenever any two (2) or more of the States of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia, which are contiguous have ratified it and Congress has given consent thereto. Any state not mentioned in this article which is contiguous with any member state may become a party to this compact, subject to approval by the legislature of each of the member states.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article III.
     </p>
     <p>
      In each state, the state forester or officer holding the equivalent position who is responsible for forest fire control shall act as compact administrator for that state and shall consult with like officials of the other member states and shall implement cooperation between such states in forest fire prevention and control.
     </p>
     <p>
      The compact administrator of the member states shall coordinate the services of the member states and provide administrative integration in carrying out the purposes of this compact.
     </p>
     <p>
      There shall be established an advisory committee of legislators, forestry commission representatives, and forestry or forest products industries representatives which shall meet from time to time with the compact administrators. Each member state shall name one member of the senate and one member of the house of representatives who shall be designated by that state’s commission on interstate cooperation, or if said commission cannot constitutionally designate the said members, they shall be designated in accordance with laws of that state; and the governor of each member state shall appoint two (2) representatives, one of whom shall be associated with forestry or forest products industries to comprise the membership of the advisory committee. Action shall be taken by a majority of the compacting states, and each state shall be entitled to one vote.
     </p>
     <p>
      The compact administrators shall formulate and, in accordance with need, from time to time, revise a regional forest fire plan for the member states.
     </p>
     <p>
      It shall be the duty of each member state to formulate and put in effect a forest fire plan for that state and take such measures as may be necessary to integrate such forest fire plan with the regional forest fire plan formulated by the compact administrators.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article IV.
     </p>
     <p>
      Whenever the state forest fire control agency of a member state requests aid from the state forest fire control agency of any other member state in combating, controlling or preventing forest fires, it shall be the duty of the state forest fire control agency of that state to render all possible aid to the requesting agency which is consonant with the maintenance of protection at home.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article V.
     </p>
     <p>
      Whenever the forces of any member state are rendering outside aid pursuant to the request of another member state under this compact, the employees of such state shall, under the direction of the officers of the state to which they are rendering aid, have the same powers (except the power of arrest), duties, rights, privileges, and immunities as comparable employees of the state to which they are rendering aid.
     </p>
     <p>
      No member state or its officers or employees rendering outside aid pursuant to this compact shall be liable on account of any act or omission on the part of such forces while so engaged, or on account of the maintenance, or use of any equipment or supplies in connection therewith: Provided, that nothing herein shall be construed as relieving any person from liability for his own negligent act or omission, or as imposing liability for such negligent act or omission upon any state.
     </p>
     <p>
      All liability, except as otherwise provided hereinafter, that may arise either under the laws of the requesting state or under the laws of the aiding state or under the laws of a third state on account of or in connection with a request for aid, shall be assumed and borne by the requesting state.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any member state rendering outside aid pursuant to this compact shall be reimbursed by the member state receiving such aid for any loss or damage to, or expense incurred in the operation of any equipment answering a request for aid, and for the cost of all materials, transportation, wages, salaries, and subsistence of employees and maintenance of equipment incurred in connection with such request: Provided, that nothing herein contained shall prevent any assisting member state from assuming such loss, damage, expense or other cost or from loaning such equipment or from donating such service to the receiving member state without charge or cost.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each member state shall provide for the payment of compensation and death benefits to injured employees and the representatives of deceased employees in case employees sustain injuries or are killed while rendering outside aid pursuant to this compact, in the same manner and on the same terms as if the injury or death were sustained within such state.
     </p>
     <p>
      For the purpose of this compact the term employee shall include any volunteer or auxiliary legally included within the forest fighting forces of the aiding state under the laws thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      The compact administrators shall formulate procedures for claims and reimbursement under the provisions of this article, in accordance with the laws of the member states.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article VI.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ratification of this compact shall not be construed to affect any existing statute so as to authorize or permit curtailment or diminution of the forest fighting forces, equipment, services or facilities of any member state.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nothing in this compact shall be construed to limit or restrict the powers of any state ratifying the same to provide for the prevention, control and extinguishment of forest fires, or to prohibit the enactment or enforcement of state laws, rules or regulations intended to aid in such prevention, control and extinguishment in such state.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nothing in this compact shall be construed to affect any existing or future cooperative relationship or arrangement between any federal agency and a member state or states.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article VII.
     </p>
     <p>
      The compact administrators may request the United States Forest Service to act as a research and coordinating agency of the Southeastern Interstate Forest Fire Protection Compact in cooperation with the appropriate agencies in each state, and the United States Forest Service may accept responsibility for preparing and presenting to the compact administrators its recommendations with respect to the regional fire plan. Representatives of any federal agency engaged in forest fire prevention and control may attend meetings of the compact administrators.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article VIII.
     </p>
     <p>
      The provisions of articles IV and V of this compact which relate to mutual aid in combating, controlling or preventing forest fires shall be operative as between any state party to this compact and any other state which is party to a regional forest fire protection compact in another region: Provided, that the legislature of such other state shall have given its assent to such mutual aid provisions of this compact.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article IX.
     </p>
     <p>
      This compact shall continue in force and remain binding on each state ratifying it until the legislature or the governor of such state, as the laws of such state provide, takes action to withdraw therefrom. Such action shall not be effective until six (6) months after notice thereof has been sent by the chief executive of the state desiring to withdraw to the chief executives of all states then parties to the compact.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The legislature of the State of Mississippi recognizes that the growing demands on forests and related land resources cannot be met by intensive management of public lands and industrial forests alone, and declares that the development of forest resources on poorly stocked, idle and poorly managed lands in Mississippi is needed to insure that Mississippi shall continue to develop its forest economy.
     </p>
     <p>
      The legislature declares the development of forest resources on suitable lands to be a public policy of the State of Mississippi. The legislature is mindful, in stating this policy, that continuous timber growth of commercially valuable species for needed forest products is in the public interest, and that such growth can be attained, to a considerable degree, by making financial assistance available to private non-industrial landowners for developing forest resources on desirable and suitable sites.

       The application of prescribed burning is a landowner property right and a land management tool that benefits the safety of the public, the environment and the economy of Mississippi. Pursuant thereto, the Legislature finds that:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t49c19s49-19-303ol11a">
         Prescribed burning reduces naturally occurring vegetative fuels within wild land areas. Reduction of the fuel load reduces the risk and severity of major catastrophic wildfire, thereby reducing the threat of loss of life and property, particularly in urbanizing areas.
        </li>
        <li id="t49c19s49-19-303ol11b">
         Most of Mississippi’s natural communities require periodic fire for maintenance of their ecological integrity. Prescribed burning is essential to the perpetuation, restoration and management of many plant and animal communities. Significant loss of the state’s biological diversity will occur if fire is excluded from fire-dependent systems.
        </li>
        <li id="t49c19s49-19-303ol11c">
         Forest lands constitute significant economic, biological and aesthetic resources of statewide importance. Prescribed burning on forest land prepares sites for reforestation, removes undesirable competing vegetation, expedites nutrient cycling and controls or eliminates certain forest pathogens.
        </li>
        <li id="t49c19s49-19-303ol11d">
         The state manages hundreds of thousands of acres of land for parks, wildlife management areas, forests and other public purposes. The use of prescribed burning for management of public lands is essential to maintain the specific resource values for which these lands were acquired.
        </li>
        <li id="t49c19s49-19-303ol11e">
         Proper training in the use of prescribed burning is necessary to ensure maximum benefits and protection for the public.
        </li>
        <li id="t49c19s49-19-303ol11f">
         As Mississippi’s population continues to grow, pressures from liability issues and nuisance complaints inhibit the use of prescribed burning.

      As used in Sections 49-19-301 through 49-19-307 unless the context requires otherwise:
     </p>
     <p>
      “Prescribed burning” means the controlled application of fire to naturally occurring vegetative fuels for ecological, silvicultural and wildlife management purposes under specified environmental conditions and the following of appropriate precautionary measures which cause the fire to be confined to a predetermined area and accomplishes the planned land management objectives.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Certified prescribed burn manager” means an individual or county forester who successfully completes the certification program approved by the Mississippi Forestry Commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Prescription” means a written plan for starting and controlling a prescribed burn to accomplish the ecological, silvicultural and wildlife management objectives.

     <p>
      The Legislature hereby finds and declares that the erection and maintenance of outdoor advertising signs, displays and devices in areas adjacent to state controlled routes should be controlled in order to protect the public investment in such highways, to promote the safety and recreational value of public travel, and to preserve natural beauty. Any advertising device subject to Sections 49-23-1 through 49-23-29, and found to be in violation thereof, is subject to removal under the state’s police power where not contrary to provisions provided herein. It is the intention of the Legislature in such sections to provide a statutory basis for regulation of outdoor advertising consistent with the public policy declared by Congress in areas adjacent to state controlled routes.

      <p>
       The 2004 amendment added the last two sentences in (5) to prohibit the governing authorities of any municipality or the board of supervisors of any county from imposing fees or privilege licenses upon certain business advertizing signs lawfully located on the premises of such businesses.

     <p>
      When the State Highway Commission determines that the topography of the land adjoining the highways will not permit adequate screening of junkyards, or the screening of such junkyards would not be economically feasible, the State Highway Commission shall have the authority to acquire by gift, purchase, exchange, or condemnation such interests in lands as may be necessary to secure the removal or disposal of the junkyards, and to pay just compensation for the costs of relocation, removal or disposal thereof. When the state highway commission determines that it is in the best interest of the state, it may acquire such lands, or interest in lands, outside highway rights-of-way as may be necessary to provide adequate screening of such junkyards.

      The Legislature finds that channel maintenance is necessary to preserve and enhance the economic stability and recreational potential of the coastal region. The Legislature declares it to be a governmental responsibility to provide for proper channel maintenance. The Legislature further declares that channel maintenance projects are in the public interest. Those projects should be funded to promote the use of cost-efficient strategies, encourage coordination among federal, state and local governments and the private sector, provide for long-term solutions and minimize the impact of the environment to the extent possible.

     </h3>
     <p>
      For purposes of this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section:
     </p>
     <p>
      “Marina” means a facility providing more than twelve (12) mooring spaces for boats that may provide supplies and services including electricity, fresh water, fuel or sewage collection facilities.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Public marina” means a marina that offers mooring spaces and docking facilities for lease by the general public. Public marinas include recreational and commercial marinas, and they require a “C” for commercial or “I” for industrial use designation.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Private single-family or multi-family pier” means a pier that is part of an adjacent single-family home subdivision or multi-family condominium or apartment development that provides mooring spaces and docking facilities restricted for use by only home owners or tenants of the adjacent development. Private single-family and multi-family piers with twelve (12) or fewer mooring spaces are compatible with a “G” for general use designation. Private single-family and multi-family piers with more than twelve (12) mooring spaces require a “C” for commercial use designation. Commercial vessels may not be moored in a multi-family pier.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Yacht club marina” means a marina that restricts mooring spaces and docking facilities to members only of a private association organization. Yacht clubs require a “C” for commercial or “I” for industrial use designation.

   In contesting a wetlands permit defendant Mississippi Department of Marine Resources failed to show an adverse impact due to the landowner’s construction of a pier addition, given that a future boat ramp for larger vessels was planned for the same area, thus, the chancellor’s decision reversing the decision of the Commission on Marine Resources denying plaintiff landowners’ request for a wetlands permit to build a pier addition and fill part of a marsh for a parking lot was supported by substantial evidence; the construction would not obstruct the ebb and flow of the tide, an exception described in Miss.

       Emergency removal.Any derelict vessel within any designated navigation channel or within one hundred (100) yards of the boundaries of any state, county or municipal port may be declared a hazard to navigation and subject to immediate removal and disposal by the department. Any derelict vessel that is leaking any hazardous substances, chemicals or fuels may be declared an environmental hazard and subject to immediate removal and disposal by the department. The owners of a vessel removed in accordance with this subsection are liable for the costs associated with the salvage and disposal of the vessel and any damages to the flora and fauna within the affected area. The department is not liable for damages resulting from relocation or removal unless the damage results from gross negligence or willful misconduct.

       Cost recovery.(a) Any party with standing may seek full cost recovery from the owner of the derelict vessel for any expense incurred as a result of, or incidental to, removing the vessel. The owner of the vessel is liable for the costs of removal, storage and restoration of affected lands. If ownership of the vessel transfers under subsection (5)(c), then the original owner is liable for double the costs of removal, storage, restoration of affected lands, attorneys’ fees, and all costs of court.

      <li id="t49c27s49-27-71ol11b3c4d9">
       Department authorities.(a) The department is authorized to enter into contracts with individuals, firms and corporations for the removal of vessels. The salvage value, if any, of the vessel may be used to offset the costs of the removal of the vessel and the restoration of the affected area. The department may enter into noncompetitive contracts or agreements with any state or federal entity for the removal of vessels.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Prior to disposition of the vessel, the department or the party with standing must inquire of the Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks as to the status of the vessel in regard to the Mississippi Boating Law of 1960, Section 59-21-1 et seq. The inquiry must provide the description of the vessel, including the vessel registration number. Upon request of the Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks, satisfactory evidence must be furnished as to dereliction in compliance with this section. The Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks will advise the inquirer of proper registration procedures, where indicated, depending on the method of disposition of the vessel.
     </p>
     <p>
      On registration, title to the derelict vessel vests with the person or governmental agency that registered it. No liabilities incurred by the vessel or the vessel owner transfer along with the title. Any vessel transferred under this subsection may be disposed of without additional notice to the original owner of the vessel. Any value retrieved from the sale or disposal of the vessel offsets the costs of removal and storage attributed to the original owner.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any person who acts in good faith and without malicious intent in the processing, storage or movement of any derelict vessel pursuant to this section is immune from civil liability for damage to the vessel.
     </p>
     <p>
      The owner of the vessel is also liable for a fine of Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) per day. However, no fine will be charged if the vessel is reclaimed by the owner and all expenses paid before the title transfers under this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      The chancery court may, in its discretion, order damages up to Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) per day for every day the vessel was left abandoned or derelict, beginning on the day of the first posting of notice. If the vessel was removed prior to the title transferring under subsection (5), then no such damages will be assessed. The vessel owner is liable for reasonable attorneys’ fees and all costs of court.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a party with standing desires to require the owner to remove the vessel, then he may apply to the chancery court for a writ of mandatory injunction ordering the owner to remove the vessel. The chancery court must allow a reasonable time for removal and restoration of the affected lands. The chancery court may order further damages not to exceed Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) per day for each day that the violation exists beyond the date set by the court in an injunction for the removal of the vessel and restoration of the affected lands.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any court-ordered reimbursed costs or damages in excess of the actual costs of removal and restoration must be deposited in a special fund in the State Treasury known as the “Derelict Vessel Fund” administered by the department. Any funds deposited in the fund must be used to cover the administrative costs and removal costs incurred by the department for the removal of vessels. Any remaining funds must be used to cover the costs of removing additional derelict vessels.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Commission on Marine Resources shall adopt rules and regulations necessary and appropriate to carry out this section. The commission may also enter into interstate or intrastate efforts toward this end, and may seek and utilize aid from all federal, state, and local sources in this endeavor.

     <p>
      The State of Mississippi, the Commission on Marine Resources, the department, and their employees and representatives shall not be liable for any damages resulting from the removal, sale or disposal of any vessel declared derelict or hazardous under this section.

       The district may issue negotiable special improvement bonds to provide funds for the purpose of planning, design, construction, operation, maintenance or improvement of any project of the district, including acquisition of land. The bonds shall be payable primarily from special assessments authorized in Section 49-28-29 and, if provided in the proceedings authorizing the bonds, the avails of the ad valorem tax levy authorized in Section 49-28-27. In addition, if provided in the proceedings authorizing the bonds and agreed to by resolution of the board of supervisors authorizing the board of commissioners to make that pledge, the bonds shall also be payable from the avails of the ad valorem tax levy provided for in subsection (2) of this section, or from any combination of monies from those special assessments and tax levies. The bonds may be issued without an election being held upon the question of their issuance and without the publication of any notice of intention to issue the bonds. The board of commissioners of the district shall issue bonds of the district by resolution spread upon the minutes of the board. The bonds shall contain covenants and provisions, be executed, bear interest at the rate or rates not to exceed fourteen percent (14%) per annum, be in denomination or denominations, be payable, both as to principal and interest, at the place or places, mature at the time or times not exceeding twenty-five (25) years from their date of issuance, as shall be determined by the board of commissioners and set forth in the resolution under which the bonds are issued. However, any bonds which are secured by a pledge of special assessments shall mature at the time or times not exceeding the time period over which the special assessments are payable, as determined by the board of commissioners under Section 49-28-29. Notwithstanding any provision of general law to the contrary, any bonds and interest coupons issued under this chapter shall possess all of the qualities of negotiable instruments, and the bonds, premium, if any, and interest thereon shall be exempt from all state, county, municipal and other taxation under the laws of the State of Mississippi. Any bonds issued under the authority of this chapter may be refunded in the manner provided in this chapter upon a finding by the board of commissioners that the refunding is in the public interest. Bonds for the improvement or extension of any structures or facilities of the district may be included with any refunding bonds. The bonds may be sold without the necessity of advertising for bids and may be sold by negotiated private sale and on any terms, conditions and covenants as may be agreed to by and between the issuing authority and the purchasers of the bonds. The total amount of bonds issued under this chapter shall not exceed One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00).

The avails of the tax, together with any other monies available for that purpose, shall be sufficient to provide for the payment of the principal of and interest on the bonds as the principal and interest falls due. If provided in the proceedings for the issuance of the bonds, the avails of the tax may also be used to replenish any reserve fund established for the bonds.

      If the board of commissioners determines that the front foot rule is the most equitable method of distributing the cost among the properties, then the resolution shall direct that the cost to be assessed against each lot or parcel of land shall be determined by dividing the entire cost to be assessed by the total number of front feet of real property abutting upon the shoreline on which the project is located and which will be subject to the special assessment, and multiplying the quotient by the total number of front feet in any particular lot or parcel of land fronting in the beach on which the project is located. The result of this formula shall be assessed against each lot or parcel of land for the owner’s part of the cost of the entire improvement to be paid through special assessments.

      If the board of commissioners determines that the area rule is the most equitable method of distributing the cost among the properties, then the resolution shall direct that the cost to be assessed against each lot or parcel of land shall be determined by dividing the entire cost to be assessed by the total number of acres or square feet in the area being benefited and that is subject to the special assessment, and multiplying the quotient by the total number of acres or square feet in any particular lot or parcel of land.

       § 49-31-3.
    Legislative findings.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The Legislature finds that:
     </p>
     <p>
      Inefficient and improper methods of managing waste create hazards to public health, cause pollution of the air and water resources and constitute a waste of natural resources;
     </p>
     <p>
      Problems in preventing pollution are statewide in scope and necessitate state action in improving methods and processes to promote more efficient methods of managing and reducing the waste generated in the state;
     </p>
     <p>
      The economic and population growth of our state and improvements in the standard of living enjoyed by our population have required increased industrial production which, coupled with expanding commercial and agricultural operations, have resulted in a rise in the amounts of waste generated;
     </p>
     <p>
      State government should take a proactive role to assist business, industry, academic institutions, governmental entities and the citizens of the state in the development of a coordinated pollution prevention program that addresses the need for both environmental protection and economic growth;
     </p>
     <p>
      There are significant opportunities for business, industry, academic institutions and governmental entities to eliminate or reduce the generation of waste at the source through cost-effective pollution prevention technologies and procedures. Use of these technologies and procedures offers business, industry, academic institutions and governmental entities savings in materials, waste management and liability costs;
     </p>
     <p>
      The opportunities for pollution prevention are often not realized because existing regulations focus more upon treatment and disposal than pollution prevention and do not emphasize multimedia management of waste; and
     </p>
     <p>
      Pollution prevention is the ultimate goal in waste management. The use of pollution prevention policies and technologies as an integral part of the waste management system, thereby reducing the need for the creation of additional management capacity, is strongly endorsed.

       The Legislature declares it to be the policy of the State of Mississippi that the generation of waste should be reduced or eliminated at the source, whenever feasible; waste that is generated should be recycled or reused whenever feasible; waste that cannot be reduced or recycled should be treated in an environmentally safe manner; and disposal or other permitted release into the environment should be employed only as a last resort and should be conducted in an environmentally safe manner.

       The state’s goal is to reduce the quantity of waste generated within Mississippi by a minimum of twenty-five percent (25%) by January 1, 1996. For purposes of measuring the reduction of hazardous waste, the department shall use as a baseline the quantity of hazardous waste generated, as reported for the 1989 calendar year. For purposes of measuring the reduction of nonhazardous solid waste, the department shall use as a baseline information submitted to the State Tax Commission pursuant to Section 17-17-219 for the 1992 calendar year.

     </h3>
     <p>
      For purposes of this chapter the following terms shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section or in Section 17-17-3 unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:
     </p>
     <p>
      “Department” means the Department of Environmental Quality.
     </p>
     <p>
      “EPCRA” means the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act, Public Law 99-499, as amended.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Facility operator” means an operator of a facility required to file a report of toxic chemical releases under Section 313 of EPCRA.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Generator” means any person whose act or process produces waste.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Multimedia” means all environmental media including, but not limited to air, water and land.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Pollution prevention” means any action taken by business, industry, government or individual consumers to conserve natural resources while providing and using needed products in a manner that prevents or reduces the generation, disposal or release of pollutants to the environment. Pollution prevention does not include dewatering, dilution or evaporation before handling, release, storage, treatment or disposal of hazardous waste.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Recovered materials” means those materials having known recycling potential, which can be feasibly recycled and have been diverted or removed from the waste stream for sale, use or reuse, by separation, collection or processing.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Recyclable materials” means those materials which are reasonably capable of being recycled and which would otherwise be processed or disposed of as waste.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Recycling” means the use, reuse or reclamation of a waste. Recycling does not include the burning of waste as a fuel for the recovery of energy or the use of waste treatment technologies.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Waste” means sewage, industrial wastes, oil field wastes, and all other liquid, gaseous, solid or other substances which may pollute the lands, waters or air of the state.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Waste minimization” means the reduction, to the extent feasible, of waste that is generated or subsequently treated, stored or disposed of. It includes any source reduction or recycling activity undertaken by a generator or facility operator that results in either (i) the reduction of total volume or quantity of waste, or (ii) the reduction of toxicity or other characteristics of hazardous waste, or both, so long as the reduction does not result in the displacement of pollutants from one medium to another and is consistent with the goal of minimizing present and future threats to human health and the environment.

       Laws of 2009, ch. 308, §§ 1 through 3 provide:
      </p>
      <p>
       “SECTION 1. (1) The Legislature finds that electronic equipment waste is among the fastest growing segment of Mississippi’s solid waste stream. The state must frequently upgrade and replace computers, telecommunication devices and other technologically sophisticated equipment necessary to the efficient operation of state government. The necessary purchase of up-to-date computers, telecommunications devices and other technological equipment for state government use often results in a surplus of property that, while unfit for state government purposes, is still useful and marketable or transferable to other public or nonprofit entities for less complex and less high-speed dependent use. In addition, due to the sensitive information contained in almost all electronic equipment memory components, a stringent data management process is required to ensure that sensitive data is not inadvertently compromised. By the time the surplus property is delivered to the Office of Surplus Property of the Department of Finance and Administration, it is generally technologically obsolete and has lost considerable value resulting in a significant waste of potential revenue to the State of Mississippi.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(2) The purpose of this act is to establish a process for the development of state policy for Recycling and Asset Disposition (READ) Services targeting state agency-generated obsolete electronic equipment in order to:
      </p>
      <p>
       “(2)(a) Achieve the maximum possible benefit from use of state agency-owned electronic equipment;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(2)(b) Ensure a data security process that prevents the inadvertent release of sensitive state-owned electronic information to unauthorized parties during the disposal process;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(2)(c) Achieve maximum benefit from sale and/or recycling of surplus state agency electronic equipment; and
      </p>
      <p>
       “(2)(d) Protect the public health, safety and the environment by mandating that steps be taken to address the solid waste management of electronic equipment and solid waste statewide.
      </p>
      <p>
       “SECTION 2. For the purposes of this act, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section:
      </p>
      <p>
       “(a) ’Agency’ means every department, division, office, board, commission and institution of this state, including state-supported institutions of higher education.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(b) ’Electronic Equipment’ means a personal computer, computer component, audio player, videocassette player, facsimile machine, copy machine, cellular telephone, wireless paging device, or any electronic item containing an intact or broken cathode ray tube. An electronic item containing a cathode ray tube includes a television, computer monitor, or any other cathode ray tube monitor or display device.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(c) ’Data Security’ means the removal of sensitive information contained in almost all electronic memory and data storage components, using a stringent data management process to ensure that sensitive data is not inadvertently compromised.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(d) ’Enterprise Security Policy’ means the document published by ITS in accordance with the Mississippi Administrative Procedures Act to establish standards for the creation of a technology environment within the State of Mississippi agencies that maintains system security, data integrity and privacy by preventing unauthorized access to data and by preventing misuse of, damage to or loss of data.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(e) ’Logistical/Inventory Support’ means coordinating electronic equipment pick-up, transportation of items to a central location for testing, auditing, and redistributing items depending on the item’s condition. Of the equipment collected, the process will also determine which items will be donated or redeployed, which items will be upgraded, remarketed, and resold, and which items will be dismantled, reclaimed and recycled.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(f) ’Management and Technical Support’ means to provide management and technical advice to ensure that electronic items are recycled if possible and not merely sent to landfills for disposal. The management process at a minimum includes: overseeing the testing, demanufacture, and reclamation process; determining the feasibility of redeployment and remarketing; reporting on the destination of major components; and certifying that usable items are reduced to reusable components and/or recycled.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(g) ’Recycling’ means the use, reuse or reclamation of obsolete electronic equipment and associated materials.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(h) ’Recycling Electronics and Asset Disposition (READ) Services’ means recycling and otherwise disposing of obsolete electronic equipment generated by state government in an environmentally responsible manner, that ensures the data security of the asset and that maximizes the state’s return on investment.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(i) ’Surplus Property’ means obsolete electronic equipment no longer in use in an agency or entity and which may have residual market value in reuse or in recyclable materials.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(j) ’Valuation Process’ means to determine the current market conditions and identify equipment that can be resold at a fair and reasonable price. Part of the validation process includes a determination on what type of a return on investment can be achieved.”
      </p>
      <p>
       “SECTION 3. (1) There is hereby created a committee for the review of issues, existing regulations and potential solutions to address READ Services to the agencies of the state. The committee shall be composed of one (1) member from each of the following state agencies appointed by the executive director of the agency:
      </p>
      <p>
       “(1)(a) Mississippi Department of Finance and Administration (DFA);
      </p>
      <p>
       “(1)(b) Mississippi Office of the State Auditor (OSA);
      </p>
      <p>
       “(1)(c) Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ); and
      </p>
      <p>
       “(1)(d) Mississippi Department of Information Technology Services (ITS).
      </p>
      <p>
       “(2) It is the intent of the Legislature that the committee, no later than November 1, 2009, develop and provide to the Legislature and the Office of the Governor recommendations regarding a policy for READ Services to the agencies of the state. Such policy should address, but not be limited to:
      </p>
      <p>
       “(2)(a) Requirements for certification that any and all data and software have been removed from the electronic equipment in accordance with the State’s Enterprise Security Policy, along with recommendations for contractual services or equipment as related to data security;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(2)(b) Provisions for extending the useful life of electronic equipment by maximizing reuse of such equipment by other state agencies;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(2)(c) Provisions for donation of electronic equipment to public schools, local governments or other nonprofit organizations under certain defined circumstances;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(2)(d) Regulations and recommendations for logistical/inventory support, management and technical support, and a valuation process of READ Services as related to state agency-generated electronic equipment surplus property;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(2)(e) Recommendations for funding the READ Services for state agency-generated electronic equipment surplus property; and
      </p>
      <p>
       “(2)(f) Recommendations related to the environmental considerations for the safe disposal of hazardous components contained in obsolete electronic equipment.”

     <ol>
      <li id="t49c33s49-33-9ol11">
       Right of action: Any action by the State of Mississippi that constitutes an inverse condemnation of forest or agricultural land, timber, wood or forest products, including nongame species or personal property rights associated with conducting forestry or agricultural activities, shall give the owner a cause of action under Section 11-46-1 et seq. for the payment of awards against the entity or entities causing the inverse condemnation, notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary. The owner shall have the right to file an inverse condemnation action before any court having jurisdiction over the county in which the forest or agricultural land is located. A determination that a use is noxious in fact or possesses a demonstrable harm to the public health and safety is not binding upon a court of law and a judicial review of the action shall be de novo.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c33s49-33-9ol12">
       Subsequent repeal or rescission by the state: The entity sued in any inverse condemnation action shall have the right to repeal the action complained of in the suit before a decision becoming final. Such repeal shall entitle the owner to recover its damages arising out of the action before the repeal, and, in the discretion of the court, its costs of litigation (including reasonable attorney and expert witness fees). Subsequent repeal of the action by the state after a decision has become final shall not entitle the state to refuse payment, obtain a return of payment (if made) or result in ownership in the property by the state (absent a taking of one hundred percent (100%) of the property).
      </li>
      <li id="t49c33s49-33-9ol13">
       Payment of awards for inverse condemnation: Payment of awards for inverse condemnation shall be made by the entity or entities as determined by the court subject to applicable limits provided in Section 11-46-15. Payment shall not result in ownership in the property by the state (absent a taking of one hundred percent (100%) of the property). If more than one (1) entity is involved, the payment shall be made in the percentage of liability as allocated by the trier of fact in the inverse condemnation action. If any county, municipality, or political subdivision of the state whose actions constitute inverse condemnation as defined in this chapter are unable to pay the costs awarded, then the action causing the inverse condemnation shall be rescinded within sixty (60) days after the judgment of the court.

    Legislative findings.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The Legislature finds:
     </p>
     <p>
      There are properties in Mississippi, often referred to as “brownfields,” that are contaminated or are perceived to be contaminated by past activities, but are potential locations for redevelopment.
     </p>
     <p>
      Brownfields development and redevelopment is impaired by the potential liability associated with the actual or perceived risk of contamination.
     </p>
     <p>
      The safe development or redevelopment of brownfields will benefit the citizens of Mississippi in many ways, including improving the tax base of local governments and creating job opportunities for citizens in the vicinity of brownfields.
     </p>
     <p>
      The reduction of public health and environmental hazards on existing brownfield sites is essential to creating a better quality of life for the citizens of this state.
     </p>
     <p>
      This article will provide incentives for the voluntary cleanup of brownfield property without use of taxpayer funds.

      The Legislature finds:
     </p>
     <p>
      There are properties in Mississippi, often referred to as “brownfields,” that were contaminated or were perceived to have been contaminated by past activities, but are attractive locations for redevelopment.
     </p>
     <p>
      The safe development or redevelopment of brownfields would benefit the citizens of Mississippi in many ways, including improving the tax base of local governments and creating job opportunities for citizens in the vicinity of brownfields.
     </p>
     <p>
      Owners and prospective developers and redevelopers of brownfields, local governments in which brownfields are located and federal and state government agencies should be encouraged to provide capital and labor to improve brownfields so that the property can be determined to be safe or made safe for appropriate future use.
     </p>
     <p>
      The reduction of public health and environmental hazards on existing brownfield sites is essential to creating a better quality of life for the citizens of this state.
     </p>
     <p>
      Section 49-35-27, Mississippi Code of 1972, requires the Department of Environmental Quality to conduct a survey of incentive programs in other states for cleanup of contaminated sites by January 1, 1999. The department has conducted its survey and filed its report showing incentives provided in other states.
