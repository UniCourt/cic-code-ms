       To maintain claim of defamation, plaintiff must establish false and defamatory statement concerning plaintiff, unprivileged publication to third party, fault amounting at least to negligence on part of publisher, and, either actionability of statement irrespective of special harm, or existence of special harm caused by publication. Boone v. Wal-Mart Stores, 680 So. 2d 844, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 500 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Fault in defamation cases involving private persons, regardless of their social standing, or ranks and privileges, may be predicated on negligence of publisher; plaintiff is not required to prove malice. Boone v. Wal-Mart Stores, 680 So. 2d 844, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 500 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       In order for merchant to be immune from liability on defamation claim arising from questioning of customer by merchant for purpose of ascertaining whether or not customer is guilty of shoplifting, pursuant to state merchant immunity statute, merchant must prove that it conducted questioning of suspected shoplifter in reasonable manner. Boone v. Wal-Mart Stores, 680 So. 2d 844, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 500 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>

       “Libel” is method of defamation expressed in writing. McCullough v. Cook, 679 So. 2d 627, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 434 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Claim of defamation requires that plaintiff establish false and defamatory statement which concerns plaintiff, unprivileged publication of statement to third party, fault amounting to at least negligence on part of publisher, and either actionability of statement irrespective of special harm or existence of special harm caused by publication. McCullough v. Cook, 679 So. 2d 627, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 434 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Threshold question in any defamation action is whether published statements are false. McCullough v. Cook, 679 So. 2d 627, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 434 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Action of sheriff in giving license tag number of vehicle which was seized in drug arrest, which had formerly belonged to county chancery clerk and which still had license tag numbers issued in clerk’s name despite sale to individual involved in drug arrest, to reporter without indicating conflict as to ownership was false statement and was actionable as result of material omissions on part of sheriff, even though statement that vehicle was registered to clerk was absolutely true; sheriff knew, and failed to state to reporter, that license tags had been expired for 16 months, or that clerk had sold vehicle but that new license tags had not been issued. McCullough v. Cook, 679 So. 2d 627, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 434 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Material omissions from reports of true facts are capable of creating defamatory impression. McCullough v. Cook, 679 So. 2d 627, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 434 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Public figure who brings libel action can only prevail by proving through clear and convincing evidence that publisher acted with actual malice. McCullough v. Cook, 679 So. 2d 627, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 434 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       “Actual malice,” showing of which on part of publisher must be made in order to allow recovery by public figure in libel action, is defined as ill will or reckless disregard of falsity of statements made. McCullough v. Cook, 679 So. 2d 627, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 434 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>

   Where an author, after tape recording interviews with psychoanalyst, wrote magazine article which was later published as book and which contained lengthy passages in quotation marks attributed to psychoanalyst, some of which had no identical statement appearing in author’s taped interviews, author was not entitled to summary judgment in suit by psychoanalyst for libel, because deliberate alteration of words uttered by public figure does not equate with knowledge of falsity for purpose of New York Times standard, unless alteration results in material change in meaning conveyed by statement; and with respect to some of the quotations, evidence presented question for jury whether author acted with knowledge of falsity or with reckless disregard as to truth or falsity. Masson v. New Yorker Magazine, <cite class="us_code">501 U.S. 496</cite>, <cite class="s_court">111 S. Ct. 2419</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">115 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 447, 1991 U.S. LEXIS 3630 (U.S. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact issue as to whether misleading actions by sheriff in giving license tag number of vehicle seized in drug arrest, which was licensed to county chancery clerk, to reporter without making clear that there was conflict in ownership of vehicle were taken with actual malice precluding summary judgment in libel action brought by clerk after news story was published stating that vehicle belonging to clerk was seized. McCullough v. Cook, 679 So. 2d 627, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 434 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>

       The discovery rule applies to defamation actions in that limited class of libel cases in which, because of the secretive or inherently undiscoverable nature of the publication the plaintiff did not know, or with reasonable diligence could not have discovered, that he or she had been defamed. Staheli v. Smith, 548 So. 2d 1299, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 410 (Miss. 1989), limited, Raddin v. Manchester Educ. Found., 175 So.3d 1243, 2015 Miss. LEXIS 507 (Miss. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       There are 2 questions which must be answered in determining whether the actual malice standard should be applied in a given defamation case. The first is “Is the plaintiff a public official/public figure or a private figure?” The second is, “Regardless of the plaintiff’s status, is the alleged defamation a matter of public concern or interest?” Staheli v. Smith, 548 So. 2d 1299, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 410 (Miss. 1989), limited, Raddin v. Manchester Educ. Found., 175 So.3d 1243, 2015 Miss. LEXIS 507 (Miss. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       A public employee who was employed as a public university professor involved in geology research and grants was not in that class of higher level, decision-making employees such that he became a public official for purposes of determining whether the actual malice standard applied in a defamation action. Additionally, the professor was not a vortex public figure because the issues involved were not matters of general public concern or interest where the professor alleged that the dean at the university had defamed him in written recommendations against tenure and a pay raise. Staheli v. Smith, 548 So. 2d 1299, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 410 (Miss. 1989), limited, Raddin v. Manchester Educ. Found., 175 So.3d 1243, 2015 Miss. LEXIS 507 (Miss. 2015).

       <p>
   The purpose of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t95c01s95-1-1" target="_self">95-1-1</a></cite> is to allow a cause of action where there is usually a face-to-face encounter or where words are uttered to another in an insulting manner and which would precipitate an immediate, forceful and violent reaction by a reasonable person. The statute is designed to punish words spoken (not written) face-to-face with no cooling-off time before a physical altercation occurred. Thus, the statute did not apply where the statement was typewritten and placed on the windshields of cars and in mailboxes. Isaacks v. Reed, 537 So. 2d 409, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 585 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 1059] indicates no legislative intent that it shall operate beyond the borders of this state, but is designed to maintain peace within the state. Tattis v. Karthans, 215 So. 2d 685, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1367 (Miss. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       In the absence of a showing of a North Carolina statute similar to this section [Code 1942, § 1059], no cause of action was created by words spoken in that state and not republished in Mississippi. Tattis v. Karthans, 215 So. 2d 685, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1367 (Miss. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       In actions brought under this section [Code 1942, § 1059], the court has the power to pass on a demurrer where the demurrer is not based upon a construction of the words, but on some other ground evidenced by the declaration. Tattis v. Karthans, 215 So. 2d 685, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1367 (Miss. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the declaration brought under this section [Code 1942, § 1059] specifically charged that the original statements complained of were made in state of North Carolina but failed to state that there had been a republication of the statements within the state of Mississippi, the plaintiff could not maintain a cause of action in the latter state. Tattis v. Karthans, 215 So. 2d 685, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1367 (Miss. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       While store and its assistant manager had a legal right to discharge one of its sales clerks for no reason at all and without recommendation if they saw fit to do so, they had no right to slander such sales clerk or other sales clerks without any proof of wrongdoing on their part. Montgomery Ward & Co. v. Skinner, 200 Miss. 44, 25 So. 2d 572, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 268 (Miss. 1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       It has not been deemed requisite to introduce the customers in a store, or bystanders in a place of business, to testify as to their understanding of the meaning of alleged slanderous words, and it is necessary only to prove that such persons or some of them, heard the charges, or that the facts and circumstances would entitle the jury to believe that they heard and understood the same. Montgomery Ward & Co. v. Skinner, 200 Miss. 44, 25 So. 2d 572, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 268 (Miss. 1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       Notwithstanding that slanderous remarks are directed to several persons, recovery may be had by one of them where the charge is made in the alternative to a smaller group, as distinguished from a general class, and especially if the plaintiff is able to satisfy the jury from all the facts and circumstances testified to that injury was intended to be done the plaintiff by the implications from the language used, and especially when the plaintiff is spoken to both separately and collectively with others, depending upon what the hearers might reasonably understand therefrom. Montgomery Ward & Co. v. Skinner, 200 Miss. 44, 25 So. 2d 572, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 268 (Miss. 1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       A literal construction of the statute will not be applied by the court. Huckabee v. Nash, 182 Miss. 754, 183 So. 500, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 203 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       The gravamen of the statute is the speaking of the words, whether true or false, in an insulting manner. Huckabee v. Nash, 182 Miss. 754, 183 So. 500, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 203 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mutual exchange of opprobrious insulting epithets in violation of the statute and occurring in the same altercation is not actionable where the complaining party provoked such exchange. Huckabee v. Nash, 182 Miss. 754, 183 So. 500, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 203 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       In action on note, defendant held not entitled to recoup amount of damages arising from use of actionable words by plaintiff because of defendant’s failure to pay note, since plea of recoupment was an independent tort. Calhoun v. McNair, 175 Miss. 44, 166 So. 330, 1936 Miss. LEXIS 9 (Miss. 1936).
      </p>
      <p>
       Railroad company liable where superintendent wrote libelous letter to plaintiff’s attorney in reply to claim for damages, where malice or lack of honest belief in truth of statements is shown. Alabama & V. R. Co. v. Brooks, 69 Miss. 168, 13 So. 847, 1891 Miss. LEXIS 172 (Miss. 1891).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where occasion privileged, plaintiff must establish malice. Alabama & V. R. Co. v. Brooks, 69 Miss. 168, 13 So. 847, 1891 Miss. LEXIS 172 (Miss. 1891).
      </p>
      <p>
       The immunity of a witness, in a judicial proceeding, from liability for slander is not affected by the statute. Verner v. Verner, 64 Miss. 321, 1 So. 479, 1886 Miss. LEXIS 66 (Miss. 1886).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not necessary that the words be spoken to, or in the presence of, the plaintiff. Scott v. Peebles, 10 Miss. 546, 1844 Miss. LEXIS 177 (Miss. 1844);
   Warren v. Norman, 1 Miss. 387, 1831 Miss. LEXIS 1 (Miss. 1831).

      </p>
      <p>
       The truth of the slanderous words spoken constitutes no defense, and can only go to the jury in mitigation of damages. McLean v. Warring, 13 So. 236 (Miss. 1893).
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth of the words spoken is no defense; but their truth or falsity is an important consideration for a jury in estimating the damages. Crawford v. Mellton, 20 Miss. 328, 1849 Miss. LEXIS 39 (Miss. 1849);

Lawson v. Heidelberg E., 872 F. Supp. 335, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 212 (N.D. Miss.), aff'd, 70 F.3d 1269, 1995 U.S. App. LEXIS 34896 (5th Cir. Miss. 1995).

       In a suit to recover for the alleged libel of the plaintiff in a credit report, where there was nothing before the court to dispute the defendant’s contention that this report was made in good faith in the ordinary and everyday course of its business in answer to a request from a client for a credit report on the plaintiff, and nothing in the report suggested malice or anything more than the reporting of what was found from informants to be the facts about which a questionnaire related, the report enjoyed a qualified privilege and it was immaterial whether its contents were libelous per se or libelous per quod.

       In a libel action, the evidence was insufficient to establish malice on the part of the defendant newspaper publisher in publishing a photograph of articles taken from the automobile of a person arrested on a charge of bank robbery, which articles included explosives and weapons along with a campaign poster of the plaintiff who had run for public office and been actively engaged in politics in Mississippi, and was admittedly known throughout the state.

       In a libel action by a sheriff against a newspaper on the ground that the article stated that the sheriff had shot a person without justification whereas a deputy had fired the shot, the article was not libelous because the sheriff and deputy were acting in concert and had committed an illegal assault on a person just before the shooting so that the article was substantially correct.

       The law guards jealously the right to the enjoyment of a good reputation, but public policy, good morals, the interests of society, and sound business demand that an employer, or his representative, be permitted to discuss freely with an employee, or his chosen representative, charges made against the employee affecting the latter’s employment and on such occasion there is a qualified privilege and statements made within the scope of the privilege, in good faith and without malice, are not actionable.

       One is privileged to publish the actual facts as to the commission of a crime and the facts as to the arrest and charges made against a person suspected of the crime provided the statement does not go further than a mere report of the news by making charges, directly or by inference, insinuation, or assumption that the person arrested is guilty of the crime and if the account does not go beyond a mere narration of the transaction recounted and makes injurious reflections on the private or business character of a party to the transaction it is actionable if untrue.

       While the fact that alleged slanderous words may have been uttered in the presence and hearing of other persons who were accidentally present and to whom the remarks were not addressed will not overthrow the qualifiedly privileged nature of the communication, the fact that slanderous charges are made in the presence and hearing of others not interested in the investigation, is not an immaterial circumstance where the privilege is exceeded and the one claiming the benefit of the privilege is acting in bad faith, without probable cause, and from anger and displayed malice, in wilful and wanton disregard of the rights of the person to whom the slanderous charges are addressed.

       While instruction in suit by sales clerk against store and assistant manager to recover damages for slanderous remarks, that the jury could not award her any damages whatever on account of her discharge was proper in view of the fact that she was not employed for a fixed term, plaintiff was entitled to show that she was in fact damaged in her reputation by what had transpired, as represented by evidence that she was unable to obtain or retain employment thereafter by reason thereof.

Montgomery Ward & Co. v. Skinner, 200 Miss. 44, 25 So. 2d 572, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 268 (Miss. 1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       In assessing punitive damages in slander suit by sales clerk against store and its assistant manager for accusations exceeding defendant’s privilege in investigating misplacement of store’s money, jury could properly take into consideration evidence that defendant’s store had current assets worth more than $261,000,000 and that its earned surplus was nearly $110,000,000. Montgomery Ward & Co. v. Skinner, 200 Miss. 44, 25 So. 2d 572, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 268 (Miss. 1946).

       In an action for slander against an insurance company after plaintiff had recovered on policy, evidence that recovery had been contested on the ground of fraudulent representations, admissible in mitigation of damages. National Life & Acci. Ins. Co. v. De Vance, 110 Miss. 196, 70 So. 83, 1915 Miss. LEXIS 23 (Miss. 1915).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the communication is upon a privileged occasion and is a privileged communication, the burden is upon the plaintiff to show actual malice in order to recover. But if the privilege of the communication is not conceded, and does not appear from the plaintiff’s testimony, the burden is then upon the defendant, who relies upon the privilege, to establish it. Hines v. Shumaker, 97 Miss. 669, 52 So. 705, 1910 Miss. LEXIS 269 (Miss. 1910).

       An allegation in a declaration for slander that defendant “had butchered and sold his patrons a steer affected with a loathsome disease, and which at the time had a running sore or cancer on its leg,” is supported by testimony that “He had butchered and sold a steer which was unfit for use because it had a running sore on its leg.” Bigner v. Hodges, 82 Miss. 215, 33 So. 980, 1903 Miss. LEXIS 130 (Miss. 1903).
      </p>
      <p>
       The exact words alleged to have been spoken, or synonymous words, must be proved. It is not sufficient to prove words conveying a similar idea. Jones v. Edwards, 57 Miss. 28, 1879 Miss. LEXIS 6 (Miss. 1879).
      </p>
      <p>
       In libel suit, where defense was honest motive, held defendant might be questioned as to effect of plaintiff’s business in competition with his own. Hubbard v. Rutledge, 57 Miss. 7, 1879 Miss. LEXIS 2 (Miss. 1879).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where manifest that word was used in its ordinary and popular meaning, court should so decide and exclude evidence of technical meaning. Rodgers v. Kline, 56 Miss. 808, 1879 Miss. LEXIS 219 (Miss. 1879).

       First Amendment restrictions mandate that the plaintiff in a defamation action bear the burden of proving falsity. Burk v. Illinois C. G. R. Co., 529 So. 2d 515, 1988 La. App. LEXIS 1569 (La.App. 1 Cir.), cert. denied, 532 So. 2d 179, 1988 La. LEXIS 2528 (La. 1988).

       When evidence on the question as to whether the defendant made the defamatory statements ascribed to him was in conflict, a question for the jury was clearly presented. Miley v. Foster, 229 Miss. 106, 90 So. 2d 172, 1956 Miss. LEXIS 591 (Miss. 1956).

       Under the actionable words statute the jury are the sole judges of damages sustained, but the discretion vested in the jury must be reasonably exercised. Wells v. Branscome, 222 Miss. 1, 74 So. 2d 743, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 609 (Miss. 1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where alleged slanderous language is unambiguous, it is to be construed in its ordinary sense, and without reference to how those to whom it was published understood it or what was intended by the publisher, the jury being the judges as to whether the words would reasonably be understood in a defamatory meaning. Montgomery Ward & Co. v. Skinner, 200 Miss. 44, 25 So. 2d 572, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 268 (Miss. 1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the evidence showed that defendant store’s assistant manager in a loud and angry voice and in the presence of store customers accused the plaintiff and two other sales clerks of hiding store money with ill intent and stated that they were all fired without a recommendation, question whether the plaintiff was individually slandered was for the jury to decide. Montgomery Ward & Co. v. Skinner, 200 Miss. 44, 25 So. 2d 572, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 268 (Miss. 1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       In suit by sales clerk against store and its assistant manager to recover damages for slanderous remarks, the jury was entitled to consider defendants’ attitude in failing to tell one who is considering employing plaintiff that in so far as was known the plaintiff was all right and had a good record, as a circumstance to show whether they had acted wilfully and wantonly in discharging her for the reasons set forth in the slanderous utterances complained of, in view of the fact that there was no evidence to show that plaintiff was guilty of the accusations made with regard to trifling with or hiding the store’s money with ill intent. Montgomery Ward & Co. v. Skinner, 200 Miss. 44, 25 So. 2d 572, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 268 (Miss. 1946).

       In an action brought under the common-law slander, instructions which failed to state that the words spoken were “calculated to lead to a breach of peace,” were not erroneous as the words calculated to lead to a breach of the peace is required under the actionable word statute but not under common-law slander suit. Travis v. Hunt, 224 Miss. 193, 79 So. 2d 734, 1955 Miss. LEXIS 476 (Miss. 1955).
      </p>

       In a suit based upon actionable words statute to recover damages for plaintiff from defendant for calling the plaintiff a crook, peremptory instruction for the buyer on liability was proper. Wells v. Branscome, 222 Miss. 1, 74 So. 2d 743, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 609 (Miss. 1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       An instruction to the jury that if they believe from the evidence that such damages as the plaintiff has suffered, were caused by his own actions and conduct or from any other source and not by the publication made by defendant, they must find for defendant, was proper. Sheffield v. Journal Pub. Co., 211 Miss. 294, 51 So. 2d 479, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 355 (Miss. 1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       While instruction in suit by sales clerk against store and assistant manager to recover damages for slanderous remarks, that the jury could not award her any damages whatever on account of her discharge was proper in view of the fact that she was not employed for a fixed term, plaintiff was entitled to show that she was in fact damaged in her reputation by what had transpired, as represented by evidence that she was unable to obtain or retain employment thereafter by reason thereof. Montgomery Ward & Co. v. Skinner, 200 Miss. 44, 25 So. 2d 572, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 268 (Miss. 1946).

   A person is not a “public figure” who does not occupy a role of special prominence in the affairs of society or who has not been thrust to the forefront of particular public controversies in order to influence the resolution of the issues involved; and the New York Times rule does not automatically extend to all reports of judicial proceedings regardless of whether the party plaintiff in such proceedings is a public figure who might be assumed to have voluntarily exposed him – or herself to increased risk of injury from defamatory falsehood; there is no substantial reason why one involved in litigation should forfeit that degree of protection afforded by the law of defamation simply by virtue of being drawn into a courtroom.

       Failure of plaintiff to serve demand for retraction upon newspaper and wire service before filing civil action for libel requires dismissal of libel action; dismissal is without prejudice, where newspaper and wire service had suffered no substantial prejudice from failure to receive demand for retraction, in that filing of claim placed newspaper and wire service on notice of nature and identity of plaintiff’s claims.

       This statute [Code 1942, § 1060] has no application to nuisances involving gambling and the sale of intoxicating liquors, and does not authorize a decree including a prohibition against the removal of any of the personal property from the premises; a decree in such respect is void and cannot sustain a conviction of contempt for violation thereof.

      Such action shall be brought in the chancery court of the county in which the property is located, by a verified bill of complaint, stating the facts constituting the nuisance, the names of the parties, the object of the action, a substantial description of the place constituting the alleged nuisance, and a general description of the personal property used in connection therewith. The bill of complaint may contain an application for a temporary injunction, and where such application has been made, the chancery court, the chancellor in vacation, any judge of the circuit court, or a judge of the supreme court, may in his discretion, on good cause shown, on motion of the complainant, issue an ex parte restraining order restraining the defendants and all other persons from removing or in any manner interfering with the personal property and contents of the place where such nuisance is alleged to exist, until the decision of the court granting or refusing such temporary injunction, and until the further order of the court thereon. The restraining order may be served by handing to and leaving a copy of said order with any person in charge of said place or residing therein, or by posting a copy thereof in a conspicuous place at or upon one or more of the principal doors or entrances to such place, or by both such delivery and posting. The officer serving such restraining order shall forthwith make and return into court an inventory of the personal property and contents situated in and used in conducting or maintaining such nuisance. When such restraining order is so posted, mutilation or removal thereof, while the same remains in force, shall be a contempt of court, provided such posted order contains thereon a notice to that effect.

      If, upon the hearing, the allegations be sustained to the satisfaction of the court, the court shall issue a temporary injunction restraining the defendants and any other person or persons from continuing the nuisance. When the temporary injunction has been granted, it shall be binding on the defendants throughout the chancery district. If at the time of granting a temporary injunction it shall further appear that the person owning, in control, or in charge of the nuisance so enjoined, has received five (5) days’ notice of the hearing, then unless such person shall show to the satisfaction of the court or judge that the nuisance complained of has been abated, or that such person proceeded forthwith to enforce his rights under the provisions of this chapter, the court or judge shall forthwith also issue an order closing the place for any purpose until decision shall be rendered on the application for a permanent injunction. Such order shall also continue in effect for such further period the restraining order above provided, if already issued, or if not issued, shall include such an order restraining for such period the removal or interference with the personal property and contents located thereat or therein as hereinbefore provided, and such restraining order shall be served and the inventory of such property shall be made and filed as hereinbefore provided. However, if the owner or owners of any real or personal property so closed or restrained, or to be closed or restrained, appear at any time between the filing of the bill of complaint and the hearing on the application for a permanent injunction, and pay all costs incurred and file a bond by the owner of the real property with sureties to be approved by the clerk in the full value of the property to be ascertained by the clerk, conditioned that such owner or owners will immediately abate the nuisance and prevent same from being established or kept until the decision of the court shall have been rendered on the application for a permanent injunction, then and in that case, the court, or judge in vacation, if satisfied of the good faith of the owner of the real property and of innocence on the part of any owner of the personal property of any knowledge of the use of such personal property as a nuisance, and that, with reasonable care and diligence, such owner could not have known thereof, shall deliver such real or personal property or both to the respective owners thereof, and cancel or refrain from issuing at the time of the hearing on the application for the temporary injunction, as the case may be, any order or orders closing such real property or restraining the removal or interference with such personal property.

If the complaint is filed by a person who is citizen of the county, it shall not be dismissed except upon a sworn statement by the complainant and his or its attorney, setting forth the reasons why the actions should be dismissed and the dismissal approved by the district attorney or county attorney in writing or in open court. If the court be of the opinion that the action ought not to be dismissed, he may direct the district attorney or county attorney to prosecute said action to final decree, and if the action is continued more than one term of court any person who is a citizen of the county, or the attorney general, or the district attorney, or the county attorney, may be substituted for the complainant and prosecute said action to final decree. If the action is brought by a person who is a citizen of the county and the court finds that there were no reasonable grounds or cause for said action, the costs may be taxed to such person. If the existence of the nuisance be established upon the trial, a judgment shall be entered which shall perpetually enjoin the defendants and other person or persons from further maintaining the nuisance at the place complained of, and the defendants from maintaining such nuisance elsewhere within the chancery district, and may tax said defendants with all costs of the proceedings.

     <p>
      If the existence of the nuisance be admitted, or established in an action as provided in this chapter, an order of abatement shall be entered as a part of judgment in the case, which order shall direct the removal from the place of all personal property and contents used in conducting the nuisance, and not already released under authority of the court as provided in Section 95-3-11, and shall direct the sale in the manner provided for the sale of chattels under execution of such personal property as belong to the defendants notified or appearing. Such order shall also require the renewal for one (1) year of any bond furnished by the owner of the real property as provided in Section 95-3-11, or, if not so furnished, shall continue for one (1) year any closing order issued at the time of granting the temporary injunction, or, if no such closing order was issued, shall include an order directing the effectual closing of the place against its use for any purpose, and so keeping it closed for a period of one (1) year, unless sooner released; provided, however, that the owner of any place so closed and not released under bond as hereinbefore provided in Section 95-3-11, may at this time appear and obtain such release in the manner and upon fulfilling the requirements as hereinbefore provided. The release of the property under any of the provisions of this chapter shall not release it from any judgment, lien, penalty, or liability to which it may be subject by law. Owners of unsold personal property and contents so seized must appear and claim same within ten (10) days after such order of abatement is made and prove innocence, to the satisfaction of the court, of any knowledge of said use thereof and that with reasonable care and diligence they could not have known thereof. Every defendant in the action shall be presumed to have had knowledge of the general reputation of the place. If such innocence be so established, such unsold personal property and contents shall be delivered to the owner, otherwise it shall be sold as hereinbefore provided. If any person shall break and enter or use a place so directed to be closed, he shall be punished as for contempt as provided hereinafter. For removing and selling the personal property and contents, the officer shall be entitled to charge and receive the same fees he would for levying upon the selling like property on execution; and for closing the place and keeping it closed, a reasonable sum shall be allowed by the court.

     <p>
      Any building, club, vessel, boat, place or room, wherein is kept or exhibited any game or gaming table, commonly called A.B.C. or E.O. roulette, or rowley-powley, or rouquetnoir, roredo, keno, monte, or any faro-bank, dice, or other game, gaming table, or bank of the same or like kind, or any other kind or description of gambling device under any other name whatever, and any such place where information is furnished for the purpose of making and settling bets or wagers on any horse race, prize fight, or on the outcome of any like event, or where bets or wagers are arranged for, made or settled, shall be deemed to be a common nuisance and may be abated by writ of injunction, issued out of a court of equity upon a bill filed in the name of the state by the Attorney General, or any district or county attorney, whose duty requires him to prosecute criminal cases on behalf of the state in the county where the nuisance is maintained, or by any citizen or citizens of such county, such bill to be filed in the county in which the nuisance exists. And all rules of evidence and of practice and procedure that pertain to courts of equity generally in this state may be invoked and applied in any injunction procedure hereunder. The provisions of this section shall not apply to any form of gaming or gambling that is legal under the laws of the State of Mississippi or to a licensed gaming establishment and shall not apply to any licensed gaming establishment having on its premises any gambling device, machine or equipment that is owned, possessed, controlled, installed, procured, repaired or transported in accordance with subsection (4) of Section 97-33-7.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon the abatement of any such nuisance, any person found to be the owner, operator or exhibitor of any gambling device described in the first paragraph of this section may be required by the court to enter into a good and sufficient bond in such amount as may be deemed proper by the court, to be conditioned that the obligor therein will not violate any of the laws of Mississippi pertaining to gaming or gambling for a period of not to exceed two (2) years from the date thereof. The failure to make such bond shall be a contempt of court and for such contempt the person or party shall be confined in the county jail until such bond is made, but not longer than two (2) years. Said bond shall be approved by the clerk of the court where the proceedings were had and shall be filed as a part of the record of such case.

       That the defendant may not be required to incriminate himself does not render demurrable a petition to enjoin as a public nuisance what is also a crime. State v. Myers, 244 Miss. 778, 146 So. 2d 334, 1962 Miss. LEXIS 506 (Miss. 1962).

       The statutes which give the state a power to enjoin operation of gaming devices and also give the state power to abate by injunction the sale of liquor are not invalid and unconstitutional because they constitute an attempt to confer upon the chancery court criminal jurisdiction.

      </p>
      <p>
       Statutes which give the state power to enjoin the operation of gaming devices and which also give the state power to abate by injunction the sale of liquor, are not unconstitutional because they deny due process of law in that the defendants are denied the right of trial by jury.

       Slot machines kept and used for gambling purposes are included in this statute [Code 1942, § 1073] by virtue of clause, “or any other kind or description of gambling device under any other name whatever,” and “ejusdem generis” rule cannot avail to exclude such gambling devices, as doctrine of “ejusdem generis” is rule of construction to be applied as an aid in ascertaining legislative intent and cannot control where plain purpose of legislature would thereby be hindered or defeated; nor does doctrine apply where specific words of statute signify subjects greatly different from one another; nor where specific words embrace all objects of their class, so that general words must bear different meaning from specific words or be meaningless; nor where there are no specific terms followed by general terms; the general expression is not to be considered as limited only to last of enumeration, but applies to all.

       While in the absence of statutory authority a citizen, as such, has no standing to champion the rights of the public in abating a public nuisance, the legislature may authorize such action. State ex rel. Whall v. Saenger Theatres Corp., 190 Miss. 391, 200 So. 442, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 58 (Miss. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       A proceeding to abate a nuisance under this section [Code 1942, § 1073] is maintainable by a private citizen without first requesting the public officials named therein to do so. State ex rel. Whall v. Saenger Theatres Corp., 190 Miss. 391, 200 So. 442, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 58 (Miss. 1941).
      </p>

       Applying the rule of construction that where a statute enumerates and specifies subjects or things upon which it is to operate, it is to be construed as excluding from its effect all those not expressly mentioned, or under a general clause, those not of like kind or classification as those enumerated, “bank night” scheme in theatres was not within the purview of this section. State ex rel. Whall v. Saenger Theatres Corp., 190 Miss. 391, 200 So. 442, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 58 (Miss. 1941).

       Action to abate “bank night” scheme in theaters and to recover for theater admission money spent by the complainant and others who had assigned their claims to the complainant, was properly dismissed where the scheme in question was not within the purview of a statute making any building, club, vessel, etc., wherein is kept or exhibited any game or gaming table, etc., a common nuisance. State ex rel. Whall v. Saenger Theatres Corp., 190 Miss. 391, 200 So. 442, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 58 (Miss. 1941).

       This section [Code 1942, § 1073] expressly authorizes the institution of a proceeding for the abatement of nuisances by private citizens. Caravella v. State, 185 Miss. 1, 186 So. 653, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 118 (Miss. 1939).
      </p>
      <p>
       A decree abating the nuisances of selling intoxicating liquor and carrying on gambling on certain premises, and providing for the condemnation and sale of personal property used in connection with the operation of such nuisances, was not erroneous because the court decided the case on final hearing on proof submitted on the hearing for a temporary injunction alone where there was no request on the part of the appellants that they might present any additional evidence, nor demand for a further hearing with the showing that other and additional evidence was desired to be offered. Caravella v. State, 185 Miss. 1, 186 So. 653, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 118 (Miss. 1939).

       This section [Code 1942, § 1073], together with Code 1930, § 2007, as amended by Laws, 1938, Chapter 349 (Code 1942, § 2646), and Code 1930, § 1979 (Code 1942, § 2618), warrants a proceeding to abate nuisances of selling intoxicating liquors and carrying on gambling on certain described premises and a decree perpetually enjoining the defendant from operating such nuisances on the premises and providing for the condemnation and sale of all personal property used in connection therewith, where the lawful use of the real estate involved is not restrained.

       That a public nuisance may also be a violation of the criminal law does not reduce the authority of the chancery court to enjoin it. State v. Myers, 244 Miss. 778, 146 So. 2d 334, 1962 Miss. LEXIS 506 (Miss. 1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the statute [Code 1942, § 1073] did not give to the chancery court power to enjoin a defendant from violating the liquor and gambling laws anywhere in the state, other than on the premises found to be a common nuisance, an injunction which undertook to prohibit the defendant from having intoxicating liquors and gambling devices in his possession at places, other than the place ordered to be abated as a nuisance, was invalid, so that a defendant, charged with violating the invalid portion of the injunction, was improperly found to be in contempt of court. Horne v. State, 232 Miss. 252, 98 So. 2d 653, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 465 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       The possession of slot machines was in violation of an injunction against violation of gambling laws, regardless of whether machines were operated. Stevens v. State, 225 Miss. 48, 82 So. 2d 645, 1955 Miss. LEXIS 557 (Miss. 1955).
      </p>
      <p>
       A temporary injunction may issue where it appears that intoxicating liquors and slot machines were stored and exhibited at a motor court and cafe in violation of statute. McBride v. State, 221 Miss. 508, 73 So. 2d 154, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 557 (Miss. 1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant operated a combination cafe and dance hall which was declared to be a public nuisance, there was no adequate remedy at law for relief of this nuisance and it was within the inherent power of the chancery court to enjoin the operation of the cafe in the manner constituting the nuisance. Green v. State, 212 Miss. 846, 56 So. 2d 12, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 317 (Miss. 1952).

       In an action to abate a gambling place nuisance a temporary injunction is not void because it does not describe the premises. Alexander v. State, 210 Miss. 517, 49 So. 2d 387, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 353 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       Purpose of Code 1942, § 2646, which provides that where intoxicating liquors are kept, that place is a common nuisance which may be abated by an injunction, can only be accomplished by an injunction against the person or persons, who may be ascertained and adjudged to be responsible for that nuisance but the injunction does not issue to suppress a business as such. Vermillion v. State, 210 Miss. 255, 49 So. 2d 401, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 345 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not enough under Code 1942, § 2646, that the nuisance therein defined be found and adjudged to exist, the identity of the person or persons responsible for the nuisance must also be ascertained and adjudicated and to the end, as the statute provides, that the nuisance so found to exist may be abated by a writ of injunction against the party or parties responsible therefor. Vermillion v. State, 210 Miss. 255, 49 So. 2d 401, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 345 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a suit to abate a gambling place as a nuisance, the chancery court had power to issue temporary injunction inasmuch as Code 1942, § 1073 specifically provides that all rules of evidence and of practice and procedure that pertain to courts of equity generally in this state may be invoked and applied in any injunction procedure thereunder and this evidences a legislative intent to grant the court the full use of its injunctive powers.

       In a padlock proceeding where it appeared that the defendants could have conducted an illegal liquor business in the building as well as outside the building, the chancellor was not justified in padlocking the building and depriving defendant of the use thereof for legitimate purposes. Whittington v. State, 222 Miss. 94, 75 So. 2d 272, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 625 (Miss. 1954).

      <p>
       While the court can, under this section [Code 1942, § 1073], abate and enjoin the prosecution of the business adjudged to be a common nuisance, such as selling of liquor and gambling, and require offenders to execute a bond to comply with the decree, the court is without power to order the padlocking of the buildings, where defendants have executed the compliance bond.

       This section [Code 1942, § 1073] does not authorize the inclusion in a decree, enjoining nuisance of a prohibition against the removal of any of the personal property from the premises, and, the decree being void in that respect will not sustain a conviction of contempt for violation thereof.

      <li id="t95c05s95-5-10ol11">
       If any person shall cut down, deaden, destroy or take away any tree without the consent of the owner of such tree, such person shall pay to the owner of such tree a sum equal to double the fair market value of the tree cut down, deadened, destroyed or taken away, together with the reasonable cost of reforestation, which cost shall not exceed Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($250.00) per acre. The liability for the damages established in this subsection shall be absolute and unconditional and the fact that a person cut down, deadened, destroyed or took away any tree in good faith or by honest mistake shall not be an exception or defense to liability. To establish a right of the owner prima facie to recover under the provisions of this subsection, the owner shall only be required to show that such timber belonged to such owner, and that such timber was cut down, deadened, destroyed or taken away by the defendant, his agents or employees, without the consent of such owner. The remedy provided for in this section shall be the exclusive remedy for the cutting down, deadening, destroying or taking away of trees and shall be in lieu of any other compensatory, punitive or exemplary damages for the cutting down, deadening, destroying or taking away of trees but shall not limit actions or awards for other damages caused by a person.
      </li>
      <li id="t95c05s95-5-10ol12">
       If the cutting down, deadening, destruction or taking away of a tree without the consent of the owner of such tree be done willfully, or in reckless disregard for the rights of the owner of such tree, then in addition to the damages provided for in subsection (1) of this section, the person cutting down, deadening, destroying or taking away such tree shall pay to the owner as a penalty Fifty-five Dollars ($55.00) for every tree so cut down, deadened, destroyed or taken away if such tree is seven (7) inches or more in diameter at a height of eighteen (18) inches above ground level, or Ten Dollars ($10.00) for every such tree so cut down, deadened, destroyed or taken away if such tree is less than seven (7) inches in diameter at a height of eighteen (18) inches above ground level, as established by a preponderance of the evidence. To establish the right of the owner prima facie, to recover under the provisions of this subsection, it shall be required of the owner to show that the defendant or his agents or employees, acting under the command or consent of their principal, willfully and knowingly, in conscious disregard for the rights of the owner, cut down, deadened, destroyed or took away such trees.

   Penalty under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t95c05s95-5-10" target="_self">95-5-10</a></cite> does not fit claims that fall under the definition of waste; therefore, in an action where two owners granted timber deeds for property without the consent of the other co-tenants, dismissal of an action for waste was improper because the statutory penalty in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t95c05s95-5-10" target="_self">95-5-10</a></cite> was not the exclusive remedy for the wrongful cutting of timber. Tolbert v. Southgate Timber Co., 943 So. 2d 90, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 868 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       As a “good faith” defense no longer existed in cases of timber trespass, the chancery court erred in finding that a logging company was not jointly and severally liable with the individuals for the timber trespass on the landowner’s property. Moorehead v. Hudson, 888 So. 2d 459, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 748 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       The person injured was the owner of the property from which the trees were cut. Flowers v. McCraw, 792 So. 2d 339, 2001 Miss. App. LEXIS 325 (Miss. Ct. App. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute is highly penal and is to be applied only in the clearest of cases. McCorkle v. Loumiss Timber Co., 760 So. 2d 845, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 258 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).

   Supreme Court of Mississippi overruled McCain v. Memphis Hardwood Flooring Co., 725 So. 2d 788 (Miss. 1998), to the extent that the remedies provided in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t95c05s95-5-10ol11" target="_self">95-5-10(1)</a></cite> are subject to the limitations period set out in Miss.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t95c05s95-5-10ol13" target="_self">95-5-10(3)</a></cite> was not manifestly wrong or clearly erroneous despite an award of compensatory damages for the cutting down of trees because the cutting was done mistakenly.

   Subsection 2 is subject to the statute of limitations provided in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t95c05s95-5-29" target="_self">95-5-29</a></cite> because the subsection involves specific penalties; §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t95c05s95-5-10ol11" target="_self">95-5-10(1)</a></cite> is not subject to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t95c05s95-5-29" target="_self">95-5-29</a></cite>, but is subject to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.15.html#t15c01s15-1-33" target="_blank">15-1-33</a></cite> because it is a penalty controlled by a one year statute of limitation.

   Chancery court properly awarded plaintiffs attorney’s and expert fees pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t95c05s95-5-50ol13" target="_self">95-5-50(3)</a></cite> (Rev. 2013) where the heir admitted that he had removed trees from land that was determined by a survey to be owned by plaintiffs, and the heir had not rebutted the admitted evidence of the estimates for the damages, expert fees, and attorney’s fees. Dobbs v. Crawford, 177 So.3d 448, 2015 Miss. App. LEXIS 168 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, — So.3d —, 2015 Miss. LEXIS 630 (Miss. 2015), cert. denied, 178 So.3d 729, 2015 Miss. LEXIS 554 (Miss. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   In a trespass case brought against three timber cutters in which a chancery court ruled in their favor that an old wire fence was the proper boundary line, and the cutters appealed the chancery court’s denial of their claim for attorney’s fees and costs under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t95c05s95-5-10ol13" target="_self">95-5-10(3)</a></cite>, that statute was inapplicable because it created a cause of action for an individual whose trees were wrongly cut by another person. It was not the intent of the Legislature to permit fees to be recovered as costs by a successful defendant in a timber-cutting case. Camp v. Stokes, 41 So.3d 697, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 700 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009), rev'd, 41 So.3d 685, 2010 Miss. LEXIS 384 (Miss. 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a case involving the destruction of trees, a trial court erred in basing an award of attorney fees on the amount recovered from a lumber company because the trial court should have examined the fees requested under Miss. R. Prof. Conduct 1.5 for reasonableness. Smith v. Parkerson Lumber, Inc., 888 So. 2d 1197, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 1149 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a landowner’s action against a lumber company for trespass and wrongful cutting of timber, the trial judge offered no reason why the fees of the landowner’s attorneys were not reasonable, except that they did not prevail on all their claims; rather, the trial court awarded fees in proportion to the damages awarded. Such an arbitrary method of calculation was an abuse of discretion, and the appellate court reversed and remanded the matter. Smith v. Parkerson Lumber, Inc., 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 326 (Miss. Ct. App. Apr. 20, 2004), op. withdrawn, sub. op., 888 So. 2d 1197, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 1149 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       A contingency fee arrangement does not restrict a court’s discretion in awarding attorneys’ fees to an award not greater than the percentage of recovery defined by the agreement. McCain v. Memphis Hardwood Flooring Co., 725 So. 2d 788, 1998 Miss. LEXIS 272 (Miss. 1998), overruled in part, Stockstill v. Gammill, 943 So. 2d 35, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 624 (Miss. 2006).

       A life tenant (and those acting under authority of the life tenant) may not be compelled to respond to the remainderman for the statutory penalties set out in the statute; a remainderman’s sole remedy in such a situation is a common law action for waste.

   In a case that was removed from a Mississippi chancery court to the bankruptcy court after a debtor declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the bankruptcy court found that the debtor was liable under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t95c05s95-5-10" target="_self">95-5-10</a></cite> to pay an adjacent landowner $66,383.94 in damages, $3,642.50 in reforestation costs, and litigation costs because an agent he hired cut down trees that belonged to the landowner; although the landowner was entitled to recover twice the value of the trees that were cut and reforestation costs, he was not entitled to additional damages under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t95c05s95-5-10" target="_self">95-5-10</a></cite> because the debtor acted with the honest and mistaken belief that he owned the property where the trees were cut.

       Amount of $ 250 is the cost of reforestation, not the maximum fair market value of the tree under the statute. Murrell v. Brown, 202 So.3d 287, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 563 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court properly instructed the jury that it could award statutory penalties based on a preponderance of the evidence because a property owner sought and received damages under the tree-cutting statute and not punitive damages for trespass as the tortfeasor contended, the tortfeasor offered nothing but bare assertions to the contrary, and under a prior iteration of the tree-cutting statute, the Supreme Court of Mississippi held that statutory penalties need only be proven by a preponderance of the evidence Taylor v. Galloway, 189 So.3d 1288, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 263 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016).

       Judgment denying appellants’ motion for reconsideration or, in the alternative, for a new trial after the circuit court ordered appellee to pay damages in the amount of $ 92,901.60 to appellants was affirmed because there was no error in the circuit court’s use of appellee’s valuation for the determination of damages; there was nothing in the record which contradicted that appellee’s values were based on what the market would pay for the standing timber at issue.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t95c05s95-5-10ol12" target="_self">95-5-10(2)</a></cite> because although the landowner and his two witnesses testified about trees that were illegally cut, and the landowner claimed that their testimonies were neither impeached nor rebutted by any other witness or evidence, it was well settled that decisions as to the weight and credibility of a witness’s statement are the proper province of the jury. The jury did award the landowner $ 3,200 in damages, and based on the record, the appellate court did not find that this award was unreasonably or outrageously low; accordingly, the trial judge did not err by entering judgment on the jury’s verdict. Pittman v. Dykes Timber Co., 18 So.3d 923, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 673 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err in refusing to grant a judgment notwithstanding the verdict in a case involving the destruction of trees because it was within the province of the jury to believe the testimony of witnesses regarding who was responsible for the cutting; the evidence showed that a person not associated with a lumber company actually cut down some of the owner’s trees.

      <p>
       In a case involving the destruction of trees, a trial court did not err in denying an owner’s motion for additur because the jury’s verdict was not unreasonable; the jury awarded the owner slightly more than double the costs of the trees cut, plus the cost of reforestation.

       In a case involving the destruction of trees, a trial court did not err in denying a motion for a new trial based on a failure to allow expert testimony because such testimony was not admissible to determine whether punitive damages were appropriate.

      </p>
      <p>
       In a case involving the destruction of trees, an owner was not permitted to recover for trespass, loss of enjoyment of use, and diminution in value because there was no evidence that the owner suffered any damages that were unrelated to the destruction of the trees, such as damage to roads, fences, other improvements, or to the soil. Smith v. Parkerson Lumber, Inc., 888 So. 2d 1197, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 1149 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a property owner’s trespass suit against a construction company, the trial court properly denied the property owner’s instruction on the statutory destruction of trees as the property owner failed to meet his burden of showing how many trees were cut.

   Where the property owner produced photographs clearly showing actual damage to the land from wrongful cutting, and testified to having examined all the stumps left on the property and measured 44 trees over 7 inches in diameter, and 172 trees under 7 inches that had been cut, the chancellor erred in finding that the trees were so small that they had no market value; Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t95c05s95-5-10ol11" target="_self">95-5-10(1)</a></cite> and (2) allowed, in part, for the cost of reforestation in such cases, and also for damages of $ 55 per tree for small diameter trees; consequently the chancellor’s decision was reversed, and the matter was remanded for further proceedings on the issue of damages, including possible punitive damages, and attorney’s fees or expert fees.

   Although the landowners’ attorney was remiss in the presentation of evidence concerning damages, once the trial court was presented with clear evidence that the landowners owned the property and that the trees had been cut without their consent, the trial court was obliged to award damages in some form pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t95c05s95-5-10ol11" target="_self">95-5-10(1)</a></cite>; on remand, the trial court was to award damages to the landowners and consider whether punitive damages and attorney or expert fees under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t95c05s95-5-10ol12" target="_self">95-5-10(2)</a></cite>, (3) were warranted.

   In a landowner’s action against a lumber company for trespass and wrongful cutting of timber, the trial court erred in denying the landowner’s attempts to elicit testimony from the landowner’s expert and from the lumber company’s expert through cross-examination on whether it was reckless to cut timber before determining boundary lines, because that testimony was a crucial part of the evidence needed by the jury to determine whether the landowner should receive the statutory penalty under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t95c05s95-5-10ol12" target="_self">95-5-10(2)</a></cite>, and the testimony was admissible.

       Code 1942, § 744 allowing one to bring an action within one year after a previous action has been defeated for reasons other than upon the merits did not apply to that portion of the plaintiff’s suit which was founded on a cause of action created by Code 1942, § 1075, and therefore that portion of the suit which was founded on Code 1942, § 1075 and brought more than three years after the alleged destruction of trees, although within one year after defeat of the action for a reason other than upon its merits, was barred by the one-year period of limitations contained in Code 1942, § 1087.

       Where the plaintiff sought damages under Code 1942, § 1075, but additionally sought damages by reason of an alleged trespass consisting of items other than the specific penalties given by Code 1942, § 1075, the one-year limitation stated in Code 1942, § 1087 was not applicable to those additional items.

       The legislature never intended to base a recovery of the statutory penalty on a mere nonfeasance or omission to discharge a duty owing to another and this section [Code 1942, § 1075] indicates that it was intended to apply only to the wrongful cutting of the trees, or to some affirmative act on the part of the wrongdoer in cutting or destroying trees.

       Act of landowner in pointing out old fence line and authorizing defendant to cut trees up to that line constitutes license to cut trees up to that line and excuses and exempts defendant from all liability for actual damages and statutory penalty for all acts done within scope of license and for all trees cut before reaching fence line, even though fence line is not true property line as shown by later survey.

       In action of trespass for cutting and removing trees, instruction is reversibly erroneous which excludes from jury consideration of license, if any, granted by owner of land to defendant, and which deprives defendant of consideration by jury of this defense to all claims for actual value or statutory penalty for cutting trees.

       In an action involving a controversy over the title to land and the right to recover the actual value and the statutory penalty for the alleged wrongful cutting of timber thereon, since complainants’ evidence, together with all the reasonable inferences to be deduced therefrom, tended to establish their title by adverse possession, the court erred in sustaining the defendant’s motion to dismiss.

       A certificate issued to one in possession of public land claiming it as a homestead, under § 2290 U. S.

       To maintain trespass or debt for the statutory penalty in the commission of trespass in the cutting of trees, the plaintiff must have possession or title, and a plaintiff could not maintain such an action, where she showed no title in herself, because she showed none in the state, under which she derivatively claimed, and the lands were wild or vacant lands, unoccupied and uncleared.

       While the plaintiff, in order to recover the statutory penalty for wrongful cutting of timber, is only required to show that the timber belonged to him, and that the timber was cut by the defendant, his agents or employees, without plaintiff’s consent, the defendant may establish good faith as an affirmative defense to plaintiff’s claim for the statutory penalty, and in making such defense the defendant is not required to prove freedom of negligence, but only that the trespass was not wilful, or did not result from wantonness or recklessness.

       Where the defendant’s testimony as to his own good faith in cutting timber was not contradicted, and the plaintiff admitted that no merchantable timber had been cut, the court properly refused to peremptorily instruct for the plaintiff on the question of statutory penalty even though the plaintiff had testified that after he had warned defendant’s workmen not to cross his line and deaden any timber on his land, some trees on his land had been poisoned, but made no showing of the kind or how many trees, if any, had been poisoned after the warning.

       In an action for actual value and statutory penalty for wrongful cutting of timber, the owner of timber makes out a prima facie case out of his right to recover the penalty when he shows that he owns the timber and that the defendant or his representative cut it without his consent and if the defendant pleads good faith as an affirmative defense, he may then offer evidence to that effect.

       In an action for statutory penalty for wrongful cutting of timber and also to recover value of trees, evidence that the plaintiff notified the defendant in writing not to cut the timber and gave him a description by metes and bounds of land she claimed to own, the defendant disregarding the notice proceeding to cut the trees, was sufficient to warrant the jury in finding that the cutting was wilful, or defendant’s negligence so gross, or his indifference to the true boundaries so real, as to be tantamount to wilfulness. Sansing v. Thomas, 211 Miss. 727, 52 So. 2d 478, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 400 (Miss. 1951).

       In an action for damages for wrongful cutting of timber, the statutory penalty will be allowed only where the facts are well proved and where the testimony shows the trespass to have been wilful, or the negligence so gross or the indifference so real or the lack of good faith so evident, as to be tantamount to wilfulness.

       Mere recklessness is not enough to justify imposition of statutory penalty, but rather there must be degree of recklessness so gross as to constitute wilfulness. Howse v.

      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant was not guilty of such reckless conduct as to justify imposition of statutory penalty where he cut trees on land between fence and true dividing line which had become plaintiff’s by adverse possession after survey proposed by defendant and agreed to by plaintiff had disclosed true line, and where plaintiff had not disclosed he would not abide by such line. Howse v. Russell, 210 Miss. 57, 48 So. 2d 628, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 320 (Miss. 1950), modified, 210 Miss. 57, 49 So. 2d 809, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 265 (Miss. 1951).

       Where grantor in timber deed reserving trees around home site was to mark the reserved trees, and did so mark 50 of them, but 41 of them were cut by defendant’s employees over grantor’s protest and according to defendant’s instructions, finding was justified that the cutting was wilfully done without proper precaution to prevent trespass.

       The statutory penalty for cutting timber on another’s property will be allowed only where the facts are well proved, and where the testimony shows the trespass to have been wilful, or the negligence so gross, or the indifference so real, or the lack of good faith so evident, as to be tantamount to wilfulness.

       Where one of two adjoining owners, having blazed a trail beyond the line fence, asserting ownership as far as the trail, proceeded through his employees to cut timber in the disputed area, and his agent, when the other owner called his attention to the line fence, which was being torn down in the work, replied that he didn’t care a damn about the fence, and the next day when the other owner again appeared, with authority from his principal, told such owner to get back to the other side of the blazed trail, a determination that the trespasser was liable for the statutory penalty was justified.

       Statutory damages for cutting trees on the land of another may be allowed only when the proof shows that the cutting was wilful, which implies both knowledge and intent, or a degree of recklessness so gross as to constitute wilfulness. Mere mistake or carelessness is not enough. E. L. Bruce Co. v. Edwards, 192 Miss. 1, 3 So. 2d 846, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 2 (Miss. 1941).

       Where, in a suit for the recovery of the value of trees alleged to have been unlawfully cut and removed from land claimed to be the property of the plaintiff, and for statutory damages, the evidence was unsatisfactory as to establishment of title to the land itself, and there was sufficient justification for claim by either party, and the defendant, upon protest by the plaintiff, resumed cutting only after what it plausibly considered was a verification by survey of the calls of the deed, the plaintiff, upon the jury finding him to be the rightful owner, was entitled to recover the value of the trees, but not statutory damages.

       An instruction may state that the burden of proof is on the plaintiff to show that defendant cut trees on plaintiff’s land wilfully or with culpable negligence in failing to ascertain the boundaries thereof, and this does not contradict plaintiff’s instruction that the burden of proof was on defendant to show he cut the trees by mistake while in the observance of reasonable care.

       Where a telephone company had maintained its line and cut out undergrowth along it for seven years before plaintiff acquired title to the property by descent, the telephone company’s act in cutting away such small growth as interfered with the wires thereafter did not constitute a wilful or malicious cutting for which plaintiff could recover statutory penalties.

       One negligently failing to acquaint himself with the boundary line of his own land who employs another, though an independent contractor, to cut trees near the line on land which he points out as his own, but which turns out to be beyond the line on the land of a third person, is a negligent co-trespasser and liable for the statutory penalty.

       What is proper care to avoid the trespass depends upon the facts of each case. A person acting in good faith is not required to survey the land or resort to unusual or troublesome means to ascertain boundaries not plainly visible, but he cannot turn his employees loose in a forest with nothing to guide them save an indefinite command to cut trees only on his own land.

       The statutory penalty and punitive damages were not allowable for cutting trees on complainant’s land, where the evidence showed that both parties claimed title from a common grantor and that, while the land was entered and part of the trees were cut by defendants after they had been informed that the complainant claimed to own the land, this was done under the honest mistake and reasonable belief that the land belonged to one of the defendants.

       A property owner damaged by the spread of fire lawfully set on the premises of another is not required to establish negligence in both the setting of the fire and the permitting of it to spread, but recovery may be had by showing that although the defendant acted properly in setting the fire, he failed to manage and tend it with reasonable prudence and ordinary care appropriate to the circumstances, and as a result thereof the fire spread to plaintiff’s premises and caused damage.

       In an action for damages to plaintiff’s land resulting from a fire alleged to have been started by the defendant’s servant on adjoining land of the defendant and negligently permitted to spread to plaintiff’s land, evidence that there was a more or less general custom for farmers in that section to burn ditches, fence rows, stalks, etc., in preparation for planting, was not relevant to the gravamen of the action and should have been excluded.

       In an action to recover damages to trees and to a fence, caused by fire spreading to plaintiff’s land, instruction requiring the jury to add the penalty provided by this section [Code 1942, § 1086] if any actual damage by the fire was found to have resulted from defendant’s negligence was correct in principle. Gabbert v. Treadaway, 194 Miss. 435, 13 So. 2d 157, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 96 (Miss. 1943).
      </p>
      <p>
       Liability for the statutory penalty is not limited to cases where the defendant wilfully or wantonly allowed a fire to get onto the land of another, but expressly provides for the allowance of such penalty if the defendant “wantonly, negligently or carelessly” allowed a fire to get onto the land of others, and, since it would be necessary for the jury to first find that the defendant’s act had been wantonly, negligently and carelessly done before it would be even entitled to award actual damages, the jury should not, having so found, have ignored an instruction to add to such damages the statutory penalty, and a motion to have the judgment include the statutory penalty as well as the actual damages should have been sustained by the court.

       A statute such as Code 1942, § 1075, creating a cause of action not known to the common law and fixing the time (Code 1942, § 1087) within which an action must be commenced thereunder is not a statute of limitation, but the right given thereby is a conditional one and the commencement of the action within the time fixed is a condition precedent to any liability under the statute. Evans v. Broadhead, 233 So. 2d 771, 1970 Miss. LEXIS 1667 (Miss. 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       Code 1942, § 744 allowing one to bring an action within one year after a previous action has been defeated for reasons other than upon the merits did not apply to that portion of the plaintiff’s suit which was founded on a cause of action created by Code 1942, § 1075, and therefore that portion of the suit which was founded on Code 1942, § 1075 and brought more than three years after the alleged destruction of trees, although within one year after defeat of the action for a reason other than upon its merits, was barred by the one-year period of limitations contained in Code 1942, § 1087. Evans v. Broadhead, 233 So. 2d 771, 1970 Miss. LEXIS 1667 (Miss. 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the plaintiff sought damages under Code 1942, § 1075, but additionally sought damages by reason of an alleged trespass consisting of items other than the specific penalties given by Code 1942, § 1075, the one-year limitation stated in Code 1942, § 1087 was not applicable to those additional items. Evans v. Broadhead, 233 So. 2d 771, 1970 Miss. LEXIS 1667 (Miss. 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statutory remedy for trespass is not exclusive insofar as punitive damages are concerned. Day v. Hamilton, 237 Miss. 472, 115 So. 2d 300, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 493 (Miss. 1959).

       Evidence of a trespass committed after the filing of the declaration in an action for trespass on land is inadmissible. Gulf & C. R. Co. v. Hartley, 88 Miss. 674, 41 So. 382, 1906 Miss. LEXIS 188 (Miss. 1906).
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to recover the statutory penalties the plaintiff must show: (a) that the trees were cut on his land; (b) that they were cut without his consent; (c) that they were cut within twelve months before the suit was begun; (d) that they were cut by defendant or his agents or employees, acting within the scope of their employment, or by the command or consent of their principal; (e) that the cutting was done wilfully or recklessly without proper precaution to prevent a trespass.

       The remedy, under the statute, is an action of debt, and a count for the value of trees cut may be joined with one for the statutory penalty. Miller v. Wesson, 58 Miss. 831, 1881 Miss. LEXIS 49 (Miss. 1881).

     <p>
      The Legislature recognizes that persons who participate in livestock shows or equine activities may incur injuries as a result of the risks involved in such activities. The Legislature also finds that the state and its citizens derive numerous economic and personal benefits from such activities. The Legislature finds, determines and declares that this chapter is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety. It is, therefore, the intent of the Legislature to encourage livestock shows and equine activities by limiting the civil liability of those involved in such activities.
