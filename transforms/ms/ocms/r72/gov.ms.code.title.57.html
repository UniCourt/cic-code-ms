     </h3>
     <p>
      It is hereby declared that the state public welfare demands, and the state public policy requires:
     </p>
     <p>
      That a balanced economic development of this state is essential.
     </p>
     <p>
      That the reconversion from wartime economy to peacetime pursuits appears reasonably imminent, requiring a planning program for readjustment of employment to accord with employment problems necessarily arising from changed conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      That the present and prospective health, safety, morals, pursuit of happiness, right to gainful employment and the general welfare of the citizens demand as a public purpose the development within Mississippi of commercial, industrial, agricultural, manufacturing and tourism enterprises, herein called “enterprises” by the several counties, supervisors districts and municipalities, all herein called “municipalities.” “Enterprises” shall be construed to include expansion of such existing buildings and facilities, conditioned, however, that the municipality, if required by the Board of Economic Development, shall take security upon the existing building or buildings at the time of entering into contract for the expansion of existing buildings and facilities.
     </p>
     <p>
      That the means and measures herein authorized to promote said enterprises are, as a matter of public policy, for the public purposes of the several counties, supervisors districts, municipalities, and of the State of Mississippi.
     </p>
     <p>
      That the present and prospective promotion of health, safety, morals, pursuit of happiness, right to gainful employment, and the general welfare of the state requires the accomplishment of that which is herein and hereby authorized, in order to afford ready and attractive markets for farm and garden products, to develop natural resources and convert raw materials of farm, mine and forest into finished products for the general welfare of each of said municipalities and the entire state.
     </p>
     <p>
      That the accomplishment of the things herein authorized to be done by the several municipalities will give to them local benefits peculiar to each.

       “SECTION 2. The Legislature recognizes that the tourism industry stimulates economic development throughout the State of Mississippi in the same manner as that resulting from the location of an industrial, scientific or educational project in the state and that promoting tourism programs and projects is equally as important as attracting certain industries to the state.
   The Legislature finds that an integral component of the tourism industry in the state consists of programs and projects promoting the heritage, history and culture of the state and demonstrating the state’s attractiveness as a tourism destination for those reasons.
   Therefore, creating and enhancing opportunities for visitors to Mississippi to learn about and appreciate the state’s heritage, history and culture, including literature and the arts,
   is a priority for the Division of Tourism Development of the Mississippi Development Authority.”

       The current corporate lessee of county-owned property first leased in 1963 under the old A. & I. statutes with exemption from ad valorem taxes for an unspecified period is entitled to an exemption for 10 years from the date the county approved assignment of the lease to that company. When the 10 years has already expired and the county erroneously omitted that leasehold from the tax assessment rolls for several years, the county may not assess back taxes.

       Chapter 518 of Laws of 1988 abolished any property right that may have existed in favor of plaintiffs, who held positions in Department of Economic Development, in continued employment with Department, regardless of whether any such property right previously existed; state may amend or terminate property interests that it has created, such as employment programs and causes of action, without depriving affected individuals of procedural due process. When state extinguishes, through legislation, property interests, it is said that “legislative determination provides all the process that is due.” Buford v. Holladay, 791 F.

       § 57-1-21.
    Municipal enterprises; issuance of certificate.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The executive director shall investigate, find and determine upon application of any municipality therefor, as to whether a certificate of public convenience and necessity shall be issued to such municipality to engage in any of the enterprises deemed essential under the above declared public policy for the economic development and advancement of such municipality; and in considering and determining whether or not such certificate shall issue, the executive director shall find and determine affirmatively the following:
     </p>
     <p>
      That there are sufficient natural resources readily and economically available for the operation of the particular enterprise for at least ten (10) years, but in no event less than the period of time for which any bonds may be issued for acquiring or constructing such enterprise.
     </p>
     <p>
      That there is available a labor supply to furnish at least one and one-half workers between the ages of eighteen (18) and fifty (50) for each operative job in such enterprise within an area of twenty-five (25) miles from the proposed location.
     </p>
     <p>
      That there are adequate property values and suitable financial conditions so that the total bonded indebtedness of the municipality, solely for the purposes authorized by Sections 57-1-1 through 57-1-51, shall not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the total assessed valuation of all the property in the municipality.
     </p>
     <p>
      When the executive director shall have determined the foregoing facts favorably, he is authorized and empowered, having due regard to the promotion of the public policy and the general welfare herein declared, to issue or refuse to issue a certificate of public convenience and necessity to the municipality to engage in such enterprise. If and when such certificate is issued, it shall authorize the particular municipality to acquire, to own, to operate, to sell, to convey, to let, to lease or to rent the particular enterprise found suited to the general welfare of that municipality; but the certificate shall expire in twelve (12) months from its date unless within that time such enterprise shall have been established, subject, however, to any delays necessitated by any legislation or acts of God, delaying the establishment of the enterprise. In no event shall the executive director authorize any municipality actually to operate any enterprise, unless he shall further find and determine that the enterprise is well conceived, has a reasonable prospect of success, will provide proper economic development and employment, will add materially to the general welfare of the municipality, and will not become a burden upon the taxpayers of the municipality.
     </p>
     <p>
      If and when a certificate is issued, the executive director therein shall fix and determine: (a) the extent and the amount to which the municipality may issue bonds or make expenditures for such enterprise; (b) what property may be acquired therefor; (c) the terms upon which such acquisition may be had; (d) what expenditures may be made, and the construction of buildings, and of equipment with its installation; and (e) the method of operation of the enterprise by the municipality. If the governing board of the municipality fails or refuses to follow the requirements made by the executive director in the certificate, then the members of the governing board of the municipality voting for such failure or refusal shall be individually and personally liable, and liable upon their official bonds for any loss that the municipality may sustain by reason of such failure or refusal to follow the requirements, and in addition may be compelled by injunction to comply with such requirements.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the executive director refuses to issue a certificate, an appeal of such refusal may be taken by the municipality to the Governor in the manner and within the time that the Governor shall establish by executive order.

    Municipal enterprises; election.

     <p>
      The governing board of any municipality desiring to enter into the plan herein authorized, after receiving a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the executive director, as provided by Sections 57-1-19 and 57-1-21, by resolution spread upon its minutes, shall declare its intention of entering into such plan, and shall call an election to be held in the manner now provided by law for holding county or municipal elections, and shall fix in such resolution a date upon which such an election shall be held in the municipality, of which not less than three (3) weeks’ notice shall be given by the clerk of such board, by a notice in a newspaper published in the municipality once each week for three (3) consecutive weeks preceding the same, or if no newspaper is published in the municipality, then by posting a notice for three (3) weeks preceding the election at three (3) public places in the municipality. At such election, all qualified electors of the municipality may vote, and the ballots used shall have printed thereon a brief statement of the purpose of the board to enter into the plan hereby authorized and to issue bonds therefor or to expend other municipal funds available together with the words “For the Proposed Enterprise,” and the words “Against the Proposed Enterprise,” and the voter shall vote by placing a cross (X) opposite his choice of the proposition. Should the election provided for herein result in favor of the proposed plan and bond issue or expenditure by at least sixty percent (60%) of those voting in favor of the plan, provided that the total number of votes cast in the election shall be not less than thirty percent (30%) of the qualified electors of the territory included in the proposal, then the governing board may proceed to exercise the authority granted under the provisions of Sections 57-1-1 through 57-1-51 within three (3) years after the date of such election or within three (3) years after final, favorable determination of any litigation affecting the industrial plan or bond issue. If such election results unfavorably to the proposition, then no second or other election shall be ordered or held until the board shall determine that such election may be held.
     </p>
     <p>
      Where the separate supervisors district or districts of a county indicate a desire to enter into the plan herein authorized, but not to affect the remainder of the county, then the board of supervisors shall direct the holding of such election only in the supervisors district or districts affected, and the board of supervisors is hereby authorized to carry out the provisions of Sections 57-1-1 through 57-1-51 for such separate supervisors district or districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the event the proposal to be voted on at the election required herein includes bonds to be issued covering a supervisors district or districts, but not the entire county, includes a town or city of a population of more than five hundred, (500) as well as territory outside the corporate limits of such town or city and the proposed enterprise is to be located in such town or city or within one (1) mile of the corporate limits thereof, the qualified electors voting in the election residing outside the corporate limits of the town or city shall vote separately from those residing in such town or city.
     </p>
     <p>
      All qualified electors shall vote at their usual voting places and in event the usual voting place of electors residing outside the corporate limits of such town or city is in such town or city, such elector shall vote in a separate ballot box provided for the purpose, and the officers holding the election shall make separate returns of the results of the vote of those residing within the town or city and those residing outside such town or city.
     </p>
     <p>
      Unless sixty percent (60%) of the qualified electors residing in such town or city voting in the election and sixty percent (60%) of the qualified electors residing outside such town or city voting in such election shall vote for the proposed bond issue, computed and declared separately, the proposed bond issue shall be declared as disapproved.
     </p>
     <p>
      It shall be the duty of the county election commissioners to provide necessary ballot boxes, separate voting lists containing the names of electors residing within and without the corporate limits of towns and cities when such is required by the proposal submitted, and records for the conduct of the election in accordance with the requirements of this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      And in event the proposal to be voted on at the election required by this section includes bonds to be issued covering the entire county and the proposed industry is to be located in a town or city or within one (1) mile of the corporate limits thereof, the qualified electors voting in the election residing outside the corporate limits of the city or town, and whose regular voting place is within the corporate limits of the city or town, shall vote separately from those residing in such city or town, in separate ballot boxes to be provided for such purposes, and the votes so cast shall be counted separately.
     </p>
     <p>
      At the election, unless sixty percent (60%) of the qualified electors voting in the election and residing within the corporate limits of the city or town in which the proposed enterprise is to be located, or the town or city within one (1) mile of the proposed location of the enterprise shall vote for the proposed bond issue and sixty percent (60%) of all the other qualified electors of the county voting in the election shall vote for the proposed bond issue, computed and declared separately, the proposed bond issue shall be declared as disapproved. All qualified electors voting in such election shall vote at their usual voting precincts, and the county election commissioners shall provide necessary boxes, separate voting lists containing the names of electors residing within and without the corporate limits of the town or city wherein such enterprise is proposed to be located, or such town or city within one (1) mile of the proposed location of the enterprise, and records for the conduct of the election in accordance with the requirements of this section.

    Issuance of municipal bonds; form; terms; tax levy.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A municipality, having been authorized by the executive director, as herein provided, may expend, for acquiring and operating such municipal enterprise under rules and regulations adopted by the executive director, any funds of the municipality then on hand or available and not already appropriated or necessary for other municipal purposes. A municipality, after the terms and conditions have been fixed by the executive director and with his approval, is hereby authorized from and after July 1, 1944, to issue bonds of such municipality for the purpose of effectuating the provisions of Sections 57-1-1 through 57-1-51 and promoting thereby the public policy of this state in bringing about the general welfare of its people. When, if and to the extent that a bond issue shall be approved by the executive director, then the same may be authorized by the governing authority of the municipality, and to secure such bond issue the municipality may mortgage or pledge property used and useful for the industrial enterprise; and the income therefrom, and confer upon the holders of such bonds the rights of a first mortgage bondholder. Such bond issue shall be first approved by the executive director, and thereafter shall be authorized by resolution or ordinance of the governing board of the municipality in such form and with such provisions, terms and conditions as may be fixed in the resolution or ordinance not inconsistent with the provisions of Sections 57-1-1 through 57-1-51. Present limitations on the amount of other bonds that may be issued by such municipality shall not apply to bonds issued hereunder other than as herein otherwise provided. All such bonds shall be lithographed or engraved, and printed in two (2) or more colors to prevent counterfeiting, and shall be in sums not less than One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) or multiples thereof, and shall be numbered in a regular series from one (1) upward, be executed by the manual or facsimile signature of the president of the board of supervisors and the clerk of such board; or by the mayor and clerk of the municipality, and either of such clerks shall impress the county or municipal seal, as the case may be, upon each bond as it is issued. At least one (1) signature on each bond shall be a manual signature, as specified in the issuing resolution. The coupons may bear only the facsimile signatures of such president and clerk of the board of supervisors or such mayor and clerk, as the case may be. Every such bond shall specify on its face the purpose for which it was issued, the total amount authorized to be issued, and each shall be made payable to bearer, and on request of any holder of such bonds the same may be registered as to principal by the clerk of the issuing board. The governing authorities shall annually levy a tax, or shall otherwise provide funds sufficient for paying interest on such bonds, and the bonds maturing within one (1) year and shall provide a sinking fund for the redemption of the bonds issued. Such bonds shall be issued maturing annually with all maturities not longer than twenty (20) years with not less than one-fiftieth (1/50) of the total issue to mature each year during the first five (5) years of the life of the bonds, and not less than one-twenty-fifth (1/25) of the total issue to mature annually during the succeeding ten-year period of the life of the bonds, and the remainder to be amortized, as to the principal and interest, into approximately equal payments, one (1) payment to mature during each year for the remaining life of the bonds. Such bonds shall not bear a greater overall maximum rate of interest than that allowed in Section 75-17-101, Mississippi Code of 1972. No bond shall bear more than one (1) rate of interest; each bond shall bear interest from its date to its stated maturity date at the interest rate specified in the bid; all bonds of the same maturity shall bear the same rate of interest from date to maturity; all interest accruing on such bonds so issued shall be payable semiannually or annually, except that the first interest coupon attached to any such bond may be for any period not exceeding one (1) year.
     </p>
     <p>
      No interest payment shall be evidenced by more than one (1) coupon and neither cancelled nor supplemental coupons shall be permitted; the lowest interest rate specified for any bonds issued shall not be less than seventy percent (70%) of the highest interest rate specified for the same bond issue. The interest rate of any one (1) interest coupon shall not exceed the maximum interest rate allowed on such bonds.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each interest rate specified in any bid must be in multiples of one-eighth of one percent (1/8 of 1%) or in multiples of one-tenth of one percent (1/10 of 1%).
     </p>
     <p>
      The denomination, form and place of payment shall be fixed in the authorization therefor, and for the payment thereof the full faith, credit and resources of the municipality shall be pledged and a tax levied on all taxable property in the municipality, adequate to pay principal and interest on such bonds as the same fall due. Proceeds of such bonds shall be placed in the municipal treasury as a special fund and shall be used for no other purpose than the purpose set forth in the original resolution, and any officer diverting or assisting to divert any such fund to any other purpose than the purpose originally set forth in the resolution of the governing authority of the municipality shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, shall be punished accordingly, and shall also be liable both personally and on his official bond for such diversion, together with the costs of collection and reasonable attorney’s fees. The Attorney General is authorized to proceed by action for injunction or mandamus to require compliance with the original resolution by any officer or municipal board.

The Legislature recognizes that the tourism industry stimulates economic development throughout the State of Mississippi in the same manner as that resulting from the location of an industrial, scientific or educational project in the state and that promoting tourism programs and projects is equally as important as attracting certain industries to the state.

   Therefore, creating and enhancing opportunities for visitors to Mississippi to learn about and appreciate the state’s heritage, history and culture, including literature and the arts,

Such application shall show that the joining of the said supervisors district or city, town or village, or both, will benefit such municipality by the use of its natural resources or the employment of its labor, and that it has adequate property values and suitable financial conditions so that the total bonded indebtedness of the municipality shall not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the total assessed valuation of all of the property in the municipality, and that the joining of such municipality in the operation of the enterprise by the supervisors district already holding a certificate of convenience and necessity shall result in the enlargement of the enterprise and that such enlargement of the enterprise shall benefit the petitioning municipality.

       § 57-1-257.
    Acts of public agencies authorized for purpose of planning, design, undertaking, and carrying out project.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      For the purpose of aiding in the planning, design, undertaking and carrying out of the project or any facility related to the project, any public agency is authorized and empowered upon such terms, with or without consideration, as it may determine: (a) to enter into agreements, which may extend over any period, with the department respecting action to be taken by such public agency with respect to the acquisition, planning, construction, improvement, operation, maintenance or funding of the project or any such facility, and which agreements may include (i) the appropriation or payment of funds to the department or to a trustee in amounts which shall be sufficient to enable the department to defray any designated portion or percentage of the expenses of administering, planning, designing, constructing, acquiring, improving, operating, and maintaining the project or any facility related to the project, (ii) the appropriation or payment of funds to the department or to a trustee to pay interest and principal (whether at maturity or upon sinking fund redemption) on bonds of the department issued pursuant to Sections 57-1-251 through 57-1-261 and to fund reserves for debt service, for operation and maintenance and for renewals and replacements, and to fulfill requirements of any covenant with respect to debt service contained in any resolution, trust indenture or other security agreement relating to the bonds of the department issued pursuant to Sections 57-1-251 through 57-1-261 and (iii) the furnishing of other assistance in connection with the project or facility related to the project; (b) to dedicate, sell, donate, convey or lease any property or interest in property to the department or grant easements, licenses or other rights or privileges therein to the department; (c) to incur the expense of any public improvements made or to be made by such public agency in exercising the powers granted in this section; (d) to lend, grant or contribute funds to the department; (e) to cause public buildings and public facilities, including parks, playgrounds, recreational areas, community meeting facilities, water, sewer or drainage facilities, or any other works which it is otherwise empowered to undertake, to be furnished to or with respect to the project or any such facility; (f) to furnish, dedicate, close, vacate, pave, install, upgrade or improve highways, streets, roads, sidewalks, airports, railroads, or ports; (g) to plan or replan, zone or rezone any parcel of land within the public agency or make exceptions from land use, building and zoning regulations; and (h) to cause administrative and other services to be furnished to the department, including services pertaining to the acquisition of real property and the furnishing of relocation assistance. Any contract between a public agency entered into with the department pursuant to any of the powers granted by Sections 57-1-251 through 57-1-261 shall be binding upon said public agency according to its terms, and such public agency shall have the power to enter into such contracts as in the discretion of the governing authorities thereof would be to the best interest of the people of such public agency. Such contracts may include within the discretion of such governing authorities of public agencies defined under Section 57-1-251(f)(ii) a pledge of the full faith and credit of such public agency for the performance thereof. If at any time title to or possession of the project or any such facility is held by any public body or governmental agency other than the department, including any agency or instrumentality of the United States of America, the agreements referred to in this section shall inure to the benefit of and may be enforced by such public body or governmental agency.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding any provisions of Sections 57-1-251 through 57-1-261 to the contrary, any contract entered into between the department and any public agency for the appropriation or payment of funds to the department under item (a)(ii) of this section shall contain a provision therein requiring monthly payments by the public agency to pay its indebtedness and, if the public agency is not a county or municipality, such contract shall include as an additional party to the contract the county or municipality (referred to in this paragraph as “levying authority”) that levies and collects taxes for the contracting public agency. If the public agency fails to pay its indebtedness for any month, the department shall certify to the State Tax Commission, or other appropriate agency, the amount of the delinquency, and the State Tax Commission shall deduct such amount from the public agency’s or levying authority’s, as the case may be, next allocation of sales taxes, petroleum taxes, highway privilege taxes, severance taxes, Tennessee Valley Authority payments in lieu of taxes and homestead exemption reimbursements in that order of priority. The State Tax Commission, or other appropriate agency, shall pay the sums so deducted to the department to be applied to the discharge of the contractual obligation.

       § 57-1-363.
    Public agency authority concerning project; contracts with DECD; indebtedness.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      For the purpose of aiding in the planning, design, undertaking and carrying out of the project or any facility related to the project, any public agency is authorized and empowered upon such terms, with or without consideration, as it may determine:
     </p>
     <p>
      To enter into agreements, which may extend over any period, with DECD respecting action to be taken by such public agency with respect to the acquisition, planning, construction, improvement, operation, maintenance or funding of the project or any such facility, and which agreements may include (i) the appropriation or payment of funds to DECD or to a trustee in amounts which shall be sufficient to enable DECD to defray any designated portion or percentage of the expenses of administering, planning, designing, constructing, acquiring, improving, operating, and maintaining the project or any facility related to the project, (ii) the appropriation or payment of funds to DECD or to a trustee to pay interest and principal (whether at maturity or upon sinking fund redemption) on bonds issued pursuant to Sections 57-1-351 through 57-1-369 and to fund reserves for debt service, for operation and maintenance and for renewals and replacements, and to fulfill requirements of any covenant with respect to debt service contained in any resolution, trust indenture or other security agreement relating to the bonds issued pursuant to Sections 57-1-351 through 57-1-369, and (iii) the furnishing of other assistance in connection with the project or facility related to the project;
     </p>
     <p>
      To dedicate, sell, donate, convey or lease any property or interest in property to DECD or grant easements, licenses or other rights or privileges therein to DECD;
     </p>
     <p>
      To incur the expense of any public improvements made or to be made by such public agency in exercising the powers granted in this section;
     </p>
     <p>
      To lend, grant or contribute funds to DECD;
     </p>
     <p>
      To cause public buildings and public facilities, including parks, playgrounds, recreational areas, community meeting facilities, water, sewer or drainage facilities, or any other works which it is otherwise empowered to undertake, to be furnished to or with respect to the project or any such facility;
     </p>
     <p>
      To furnish, dedicate, close, vacate, pave, install, upgrade or improve highways, streets, roads, sidewalks, airports, railroads, or ports;
     </p>
     <p>
      To plan or replan, zone or rezone any parcel of land within the public agency or make exceptions from land use, building and zoning regulations; and
     </p>
     <p>
      To cause administrative and other services to be furnished to DECD, including services pertaining to the acquisition of real property and the furnishing of relocation assistance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any contract between a public agency entered into with DECD pursuant to any of the powers granted by Sections 57-1-351 through 57-1-369 shall be binding upon the public agency according to its terms, and such public agency shall have the power to enter into such contracts as in the discretion of the governing authorities thereof would be to the best interest of the people of such public agency. Such contracts may include within the discretion of such governing authorities of public agencies defined under Section 57-1-351(g)(ii) a pledge of the full faith and credit of such public agency for the performance thereof. If at any time title to or possession of the project or any such facility is held by any public body or governmental agency other than DECD, including any agency or instrumentality of the United States of America, the agreements referred to in this section shall inure to the benefit of and may be enforced by such public body or governmental agency.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding any provisions of Sections 57-1-351 through 57-1-369 to the contrary, any contract entered into between DECD and any public agency for the appropriation or payment of funds to DECD under paragraph (a)(ii) of this section shall contain a provision therein requiring monthly payments by the public agency to pay its indebtedness and, if the public agency is not a county or municipality, such contract shall include as an additional party to the contract the county or municipality (referred to in this paragraph as “levying authority”) that levies and collects taxes for the contracting public agency. If the public agency fails to pay its indebtedness for any month, DECD shall certify to the State Tax Commission, or other appropriate agency, the amount of the delinquency, and the State Tax Commission shall deduct such amount from the public agency’s or levying authority’s, as the case may be, next allocation of sales taxes, petroleum taxes, highway privilege taxes, severance taxes, Tennessee Valley Authority payments in lieu of taxes and homestead exemption reimbursements in that order of priority. The State Tax Commission, or other appropriate agency, shall pay the sums so deducted to DECD to be applied to the discharge of the contractual obligation.

    Legislative intent; requirement of certificate.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      It is the intent of the legislature by the passage of this chapter to authorize municipalities to acquire, own and lease projects for the purpose of promoting industry and trade by inducing manufacturing, and industrial enterprises to locate in this state, promoting the use of agricultural products and natural resources of this state, and promoting a sound and proper balance in this state between agriculture, commerce and industry. It is intended that each project be self-liquidating. This chapter shall be liberally construed in conformity with the said intent. The powers conferred upon the municipalities hereby shall be exercised only after such municipality has obtained a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the Mississippi Agricultural and Industrial Board in the manner and form as provided in Sections 57-1-19, 57-1-21, 57-1-23 and 57-1-27, with the exception that such board shall not be required to adjudicate either “that there are adequate property values and suitable financial conditions so that the total bonded indebtedness of the municipality, solely for the purposes authorized by this chapter, shall not exceed twenty per cent (20%) of the total assessed valuation of the property in the municipality,” nor that the enterprise “will not become a burden upon the taxpayers of the municipality,” the bonds authorized under this chapter being solely revenue bonds.

     <p>
      In addition to any other powers which it may now have, each municipality shall have the following powers: (a) to acquire, whether by construction, purchase, gift or lease, one or more projects, which shall be located within the State of Mississippi and may be located within or without the municipality, or partially within or partially without the municipality, but which shall not be located more than fifteen (15) miles outside of the boundary limits of the municipality; provided, however, that when any such project shall be located in whole or in part outside the municipal or incorporated boundaries of any city, town or village of this state the powers granted under this chapter shall not be exercised by a city, town or village until a resolution approving such project has been duly adopted and spread upon the official minutes of the board of supervisors of the county in which such city, town or village is located. The municipality is authorized to negotiate a contract for the acquisition, construction and erection of a project or any portion of a project hereunder (i) where the municipality finds that, because of the secret nature of such project or any portion thereof, or because such project or any portion thereof will be used for the manufacture of products to be utilized by the United States of America in the national defense, public bidding thereon, pursuant to advertisement therefor, is not in the public interest; and provided, further, such finding is approved, through issuance of appropriate certificate or resolution of approval, by the Department of Economic and Community Development, or (ii) where the municipality finds that, because of the particular nature of said project or any portion thereof, it would be in the best public interest of the municipality so to negotiate, and such finding is approved, through issuance of appropriate certificate or resolution of approval, by the Department of Economic and Community Development; (b) to lease or sell to others any or all of its projects for such rentals and upon such terms and conditions as the governing body may deem advisable and as shall not be in conflict with the provisions of this chapter; and (c) to issue revenue bonds for the purposes of defraying the cost of acquiring any project, and to secure the payment of such bonds, as hereinafter provided.
     </p>
     <p>
      No municipality shall have the power to operate any project as a business or in any manner under this chapter except as a lessor thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      The municipality issuing bonds to acquire a project under this chapter shall maintain a record of the location of projects for which the proceeds of such bonds are expended and the amount expended at each location. Such record shall indicate the purpose, amount, date and recipient of each expenditure made out of the proceeds of such bonds. If a trustee has been named pursuant to Section 57-3-21, the trustee shall make timely reports to the clerk of the municipality setting forth the details required in the preceding sentence with respect to the expenditure of bond proceeds. Such records shall be maintained as public records in the office of the clerk of the municipality and shall be available for inspection and duplication during the regular office hours of the municipality.

     <p>
      Before issuing any bonds hereunder the governing body, as hereinbefore defined, of any municipality, as hereinbefore defined, shall adopt a resolution declaring its intention so to do stating the amount of bonds proposed to be issued, the purpose for which the bonds are to be issued, and the date upon which the governing body proposes to direct the issuance of such bonds. Such resolution shall be published once a week for at least three (3) consecutive weeks in at least one (1) newspaper published in the county in which such municipality is located. The first publication of such resolution shall be made not less than twenty-one (21) days prior to the date fixed in such resolution for the issuance of the bonds and the last publication shall be made not more than seven (7) days prior to such date. If no newspaper be published in such county, then such notice shall be given by publishing the resolution for the required time in some newspaper having a general circulation in such county, and, in addition, by posting a copy of such resolution for at least twenty-one (21) days next preceding the date fixed therein at three (3) public places in such county. If twenty per centum (20%) of the qualified electors of the municipality shall file a written protest against the issuance of such bonds on or before the date specified in such resolution, then an election on the question of the issuance of such bonds shall be called and held as herein provided. If no such protest be filed, then such bonds may be issued without an election on the question of the issuance thereof, at any time within a period of two (2) years after the date specified in the above-mentioned resolution. However, the governing body of such municipality, in its discretion, may nevertheless call an election on such question, in which event it shall not be necessary to publish the resolution declaring its intention to issue bonds as herein provided.

    Security for payment of bonds.

     <p>
      The principal of, redemption premium, if any, and interest on any bonds issued under the authority of this chapter shall be secured by a pledge of the revenues derived from the lease or sale of the project, may be secured by a mortgage covering all or any part of the project or any additional property granted as security for the bonds, may be secured by a pledge of the lease of such project and may be secured by such additional security as the governing body shall require. The proceedings under which such bonds are authorized to be issued or any such mortgage may contain any agreements and provisions customarily contained in instruments securing bonds, including, without limitation, the generality of the foregoing provisions respecting the fixing and collection of rents for any projects, covered by such proceedings or mortgage, the terms to be incorporated in the lease of such project, the maintenance and insurance of such project, to include the establishment of an escrow or reserve fund for deposits of advance insurance premiums, the creation and maintenance of special funds from revenues from such project, and rights and remedies available in event of default to the bondholders or to the trustee under a mortgage, all as the governing body shall deem advisable and as shall not be in conflict with the provisions of this chapter. However, in making such agreements or provisions, a municipality shall not have the power to obligate itself except with respect to the project and application of revenues therefrom and shall not have the power to incur a pecuniary liability or a charge upon its general credit or against its taxing powers. The proceedings authorizing any bonds hereunder and any mortgage securing such bonds may provide that, in the event of default in payment of principal of, or the interest on, such bonds, or in the performance of any agreement contained in such proceedings or mortgage, such payment and performance may be enforced by mandamus or by the appointment of a receiver in equity with power to charge and collect rents and to apply the revenues from the project in accordance with such proceedings or the provisions of such mortgage. Any such mortgage may provide also that, in the event of default in such payment or the violation of any agreement contained therein, it may be foreclosed either by sale at public outcry or by proceedings in equity, and may provide that any trustee under such mortgage or the holder of any of the bonds secured thereby may become the purchaser at any foreclosure sale if the highest bidder therefor. No breach of any such agreement shall impose any pecuniary liability upon a municipality or any charge upon its general credit or against its taxing powers. The trustee or any trustees under any mortgage or any depository specified by such mortgage may be such persons or corporations as the governing body shall designate, including nonresidents of Mississippi and banks or trust companies incorporated under the laws of the United States or the laws of other states of the United States. When any municipal property acquired under the authority of this chapter becomes vacant, through unforeseen circumstances, such as default by the lessee, the municipality may exercise the authority contained in Sections 19-7-7 and 21-37-45, Mississippi Code of 1972, to have this property insured and the cost thereof paid out of the municipal treasury until such a time as the property is again leased.

      Prior to the leasing of any project, the governing body must determine and find the following: the amount necessary in each year to pay the principal of and the interest on the bonds proposed to be issued to finance such project; the amount necessary to be paid each year into any reserve funds, which amounts may include deposits in escrow or reserve amounts as advance sums for the payment of insurance, which the governing body may deem it advisable to establish in connection with the retirement of the proposed bonds and the maintenance of the project; and, unless the terms under which the project is to be leased provide that the lessee shall maintain the project and carry all proper insurance with respect thereto, the estimated cost of maintaining the project in good repair and keeping it properly insured. The determinations and findings of the governing body required to be made in the preceding sentence shall be set forth in the proceedings under which the proposed bonds are to be issued; and prior to the issuance of such bonds, the municipality shall lease the project to a lessee under an agreement conditioned upon completion of the project and providing for payment to the municipality of such rentals as, upon the basis of such determinations and findings, will be sufficient (a) to pay the principal of and interest on the bonds issued to finance the project, (b) to build up and maintain any reserve deemed by the governing body to be advisable in connection therewith, and (c) unless the agreement of lease obligated the lessee to pay for the maintenance and insurance of the project, to pay the cost of maintaining the project in good repair and keeping it properly insured. Such lease shall be made upon such other terms and conditions and for the time which may be determined by the municipality and may contain provisions authorizing the purchase of the entire project or any portion thereof by the industry or its assignee after all bonds (if any) issued thereunder have been paid in full, for such consideration and upon such terms and conditions as the municipality may determine.

     <p>
      Any bonds issued hereunder and at any time outstanding may at any time and from time to time be refunded by a municipality by the issuance of its refunding bonds in such amount as the governing body may deem necessary but not exceeding an amount sufficient to refund the principal of the bonds so to be refunded, together with any unpaid interest thereon and any premiums and commissions necessary to be paid in connection therewith. Any such refunding may be effected whether the bonds to be refunded shall have been matured or shall thereafter mature, either by sale of the refunding bonds and the application of the proceeds thereof for the payment of the bonds to be refunded thereby, or by exchange of the refunding bonds for the bonds to be refunded thereby, provided that the holders of any bonds so to be refunded shall not be compelled without their consent to surrender their bonds for payment or exchange prior to the date on which they are payable or, if they are called for redemption, prior to the date on which they are by their terms subject to redemption. Any refunding bonds issued under the authority of this section shall be payable solely from the revenues out of which the bonds to be refunded hereby were payable, and shall be subject to the provisions contained in Section 57-3-11, and may be secured in accordance with the provisions of Section 57-3-21.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The proceeds from the sale of any bonds issued under authority of this chapter shall be applied only for the purpose for which the bonds were issued. However, any accrued interest and premium received in any such sale shall be applied to the payment of the principal of or the interest on the bonds sold; and, if for any reason, any portion of such proceeds shall not be needed for the purpose for which the bonds were issued, then such unneeded portion of said proceeds shall be applied to the payment of the principal of or the interest on said bonds. The cost of acquiring any project shall be deemed to include the following: the actual cost of the construction of any part of a project which may be constructed, including equipment, machinery, facilities, attorney’s, architect’s and engineer’s fees; abstracts, cost of preparing and recording warranty deeds; the purchase price of any part of a project that may be acquired by purchase; the deposit into a reserve or escrow fund advance payments for insurance, in the event that the prospective lessee shall be in default of any payments and the municipality has to take over the operation of said project; all expenses in connection with the authorization, sale and issuance of the bonds to finance such acquisition; and the interest on such bonds for a reasonable time prior to construction, during construction, and for not exceeding six (6) months after completion of construction. Proceeds of said bonds shall be placed in the municipal treasury or with the trustee named in the mortgage or indentured trust as provided in Section 57-3-21 as a special fund and shall be used for no other purpose than the purpose set forth in the original resolution, and any officer diverting or assisting to divert any such fund to any other purpose than the purpose originally set forth in said resolution of the governing authority of said municipality shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, shall be punished accordingly, and shall also be liable both personally and on his official bond for such diversion, together with the costs of collection and reasonable attorney’s fees. The Mississippi Agricultural and Industrial Board is authorized to employ necessary competent attorneys to proceed by action for injunction or mandamus to require compliance with said original resolution by any officer or municipal board.

       The current corporate lessee of county-owned property first leased in 1963 under the old A. & I. statutes with exemption from ad valorem taxes for an unspecified period is entitled to an exemption for 10 years from the date the county approved assignment of the lease to that company. When the 10 years has already expired and the county erroneously omitted that leasehold from the tax assessment rolls for several years, the county may not assess back taxes. Approval by the county of sub-leases of the property is not an unlawful donation to a private party. 2007 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 67, 2007 Miss. AG LEXIS 101.

     <p>
      The state participation shall be used only for the purposes of Title I, Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965, as amended, and expenditures from the industrial development fund shall be used primarily for the development of industrial parks, exclusive of land purchases. If the board determines that such funds will serve a more useful purpose when expended for other purposes approved under said Title I, it shall have the authority to approve applications for such additional purposes and make contributions in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Prior to the approval of any application for a purpose other than development of an industrial park, the board shall spread upon its minutes the reasons for its determination that the additional purpose will be a better use of the available funds.
     </p>
     <p>
      No funds shall be expended from the fund for any projects other than those approved by the board, and only after such approval has been spread on the minutes of the board. In the event the board receives applications which would exceed the funds available, it shall approve those projects which appear to have the greatest potential for immediate benefit to the areas most in need of an improved economy.
     </p>
     <p>
      No applicant shall receive a state contribution in excess of ten percent (10%) of the amount appropriated to the industrial development fund by the 1977 regular session of the Mississippi Legislature.

     <p>
      The board shall investigate, find and determine, upon application of any municipality therefor, as to whether a certificate of public convenience and necessity shall be issued to such municipality to engage in the acquisition and development of a “standard” industrial park or district deemed essential under the above declared public policy for the economic development and advancement of said municipality, and in considering and determining whether or not such certificate shall be issued, the board shall find and determine affirmatively the following:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t57c05s57-5-13ol11">
       That there are sufficient natural resources readily and economically available to attract industrial plants to sites within said municipality or (in the case of a city, town or village constituting a municipality as defined in this chapter) situate in reasonable proximity thereto.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c05s57-5-13ol12">
       That there is available a labor supply to furnish workers to plants that might be induced to locate in such industrial park or district.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c05s57-5-13ol13">
       That there are adequate property values and suitable financial conditions so that the total bonded indebtedness of the municipality, solely for the purposes authorized by this chapter, shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the total assessed valuation of all the property in the municipality.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c05s57-5-13ol14">
       That the complete engineering study reveals that a suitable site for a “standard” industrial park or district does exist within the municipality or (in the case of a city, town or village constituting a municipality as defined in this chapter) situate in reasonable proximity thereto, and that it can be properly developed at costs that will make sites in the proposed district attractive to prospective new industries.
       <p>
        When the board shall have determined said facts favorably, it is authorized and empowered to issue or refuse to issue a certificate of public convenience and necessity to said municipality to acquire and properly develop the said “standard” industrial park or district. If and when such certificate is issued, it shall authorize the particular municipality to acquire, to own, to develop, to sell, to convey, to let, to lease or to rent any part, or parts, or all of said industrial district but said certificate shall expire in twelve (12) months from its date unless within said time such industrial park or district shall have been established; subject, however, to any delays necessitated by any litigation, or acts of God, delaying the establishment of said development.
       </p>
       <p>
        Should any municipality sell, convey, let, lease or rent any part or parcel of an industrial park established under this chapter, the municipality must receive a consideration therefor, equal to an amount which said part or parcel so sold, conveyed, let, leased or rented bears to its proportionate part of the total cost of the entire industrial park. Any sums received by said municipality from the sale or lease of any part or parcel of said industrial park shall be paid into a sinking fund to be designated and used for the payment of both principal and interest on all bonds issued by the municipality for the purpose of acquiring and developing said industrial park or parks.

      <p>
       The term “municipality” includes counties for purposes of this section, and this section does not require advertisement for bids; further, sales and leases pursuant to this section do not necessarily require fair market value but should be made for good and valuable consideration and not be such as would constitute a donation or gratuity.

       A county may, pursuant to the authority provided in this section, renew the lease on property used as an industrial development project with the current tenant on such terms and conditions and with such safeguards as will best promote and protect the public interest; alternatively, if a board of supervisors makes the findings required by Section 19-7-3 and same are reflected by an appropriate order entered upon the minutes, then the board may renew a lease with the current tenant without advertising for bids. 2003 Miss.

       Pursuant to the authority granted by this section, municipal governing authorities may agree to lease surplus municipal property for industrial or commercial purposes for a term which exceeds the term of the current board, upon the determination that such an extended term is necessary and is in the public’s best interests. However, as there is no specific authority to bind successor boards to the terms of the proposed lease, any such lease would be subject to the approval of such successor boards. 2003 Miss. Op.

     <p>
      Any municipality, hereinafter referred to as “the applicant,” may, on behalf of any new or expanded industry, or both, in Mississippi, apply to the board for a loan, not to exceed twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00) for any one (1) new or one (1)expanded industry, which funds shall be used exclusively for the purposes of preparatory or industrial plant training and recruitment. The board is authorized and empowered to determine whether the public convenience and necessity requires that the application therefor be approved or denied, and what amount, if any, should be loaned by the board to the applicant for said new or expanded industry. For the purpose of administering provisions of this chapter, the board shall establish reasonable rules and regulations to be followed by the applicant in making application for loans hereby authorized. The board shall investigate, find and determine as to whether a certificate of public convenience and necessity shall be issued and contract for a loan of funds to the applicant shall be made. In considering and determining whether or not such certificate of public convenience and necessity shall be issued and whether a loan shall be made or not, the board shall find and determine, to include, but not be limited to, the following:
     </p>
     <p>
      That the net worth of the new or expanded industry, on behalf of which the municipality is making said application, meets the prerequisites and requirements of the board. The applicant shall furnish upon request to the board such information with regard to the new or expanded industry’s net worth as may be required by the board.
     </p>
     <p>
      That the new or expanded industry, on behalf of which the municipality is making such application, shall submit along with the applicant, a detailed and complete study of its training needs, plans, and total amount of funds to be used for industrial training and preparatory training only, and the same shall appear to be feasible and practicable to the board.
     </p>
     <p>
      That the new or expanded industry, on behalf of which the municipality is making such application, shall submit a plan of repayment, along with the applicant, and which repayment shall be made within five (5) years after the loan, and such plan shall be approved by the board.
     </p>
     <p>
      When the board shall have determined said facts favorably, it is authorized and empowered, having due regard to the promotion of the public policy and general welfare herein declared, to issue or refuse to issue a certificate of public convenience and necessity to the applicant, approve or disapprove the loan of any part or all of the funds requested by the applicant. If and when said certificate is issued, and if and when said loan is approved, the board therein shall fix and determine:
     </p>
     <p>
      The amount of monies to be loaned.
     </p>
     <p>
      The time, amount, and method of repayment.
     </p>
     <p>
      The method, manner, and what legally valid and enforceable documents, promissory notes, deeds of trust, or contracts, or any combination thereof, shall be executed by the applicant and the new or expanded industry.

       § 57-10-121.
    Proceedings by lender upon default on loan; assignment of unsatisfied judgment to state.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      If the borrower defaults in the payment of any loan or any installments thereof, fails to follow his plan and applies any installment or installments of his loan to purposes other than those in his plan as certified by the committee, violates any of the covenants and conditions contained in the instrument securing the loan, or fails to comply with any other provision of this article, the lender shall proceed to collect the entire amount due under the loan.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the event the lender proceeds to collect the loan, he shall be required to follow the procedures as established by the committee and shall not have a claim against either the guaranty fee fund or the small businessman’s loan fund in the state treasury unless or until he has first exhausted his legal rights and remedies in aid of the collection of the loan which include, but are not limited to, his rights under the following: (a) promissory note or notes and signers or endorsers thereon; (b) deeds of trust and mortgages; (c) security agreements; and (d) any set-offs or counterclaims which include the right to foreclose the deeds of trust or mortgages and to sell, or cause to be sold, the property secured thereby and obtain a judgment or decree for any balance remaining due on the loan after such foreclosures and sale of the property given as security.
     </p>
     <p>
      When the lender has obtained a judgment or decree against the borrower for any deficiency in the amount of the principal of the loan and interest not realized in the sale of the mortgaged property or otherwise, the lender must have execution issued on any such judgment or decree. If the judgment is not satisfied following execution, the lender shall then assign the judgment or decree to the State of Mississippi, using such form of assignment as may be prescribed by regulation promulgated by the committee, before either of the two (2) said funds in the state treasury may be liable in anywise for the benefit of the lender; however, the committee may determine that it is economically or legally infeasible for the lender to obtain a judgment or decree against the borrower, such determination and the reasons therefor to be reflected in the minutes of the committee. Upon the making of such a determination, the committee will succeed to whatever rights the lender may possess in place of a judgment or decree.

    Filing of claim for payment of loan from state funds.

     </h3>
     <p>
      If the requirements appearing heretofore in Section 57-10-121 have been met by the lender and any sum of money remains due on the principal of the loan, the lender must file with the manager, on the form prescribed by the committee, the lender’s claim for the amount of principal remaining due and outstanding under the loan. The claim shall be accompanied by papers showing that the lender has exhausted his legal rights and remedies in an effort to collect the loan, or that such requirement was waived by the committee, and must include an assignment of the judgment from the lender to the State of Mississippi, or an assignment of rights that the lender may possess in the event requirement of judgment has been waived. In the event that the borrower has declared bankruptcy, then the lender must submit a final order of the bankruptcy court in that cause or such other documents that prove to the satisfaction of the committee that the lender has first exhausted his legal rights and remedies in aid of his collection of the loan. The committee shall review these papers and the claim by the lender and if the committee is satisfied that the same are in due form and meet the requirements under this article, the full committee shall allow the claim and issue its requisition according to law to the state auditor against the guaranty fee fund in the State Treasury for the balance of the principal under the loan. The state auditor shall, after determination of the legal validity of the claim, issue a warrant therefor which shall be honored by the State Treasurer by payment out of said guaranty fee fund in the State Treasury.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the balance remaining in the guaranty fee fund of the state treasury is insufficient to pay the amount of the principal of the loan remaining due, as shown by the written certificate of the State Treasurer to the manager, then the committee shall issue its requisition according to law, for the amount of the principal remaining due under the loan against the small businessman’s loan fund on which the state auditor shall issue his warrant, which shall be honored by the State Treasurer to the limit of the funds allowable in the small businessman’s loan fund.

     <p>
      The Legislature finds and determines that there exists in the state a need to assist business in the state in obtaining financing for new business or in the expansion of existing business in order to promote and develop industrial development and to further the long-term economic development of the state through the improvement of its tax base and the promotion of employment. The Legislature finds and determines that it is necessary to provide financial assistance to business in the state by providing loans, guarantees, insurance and other assistance to business, thereby encouraging the investment of private capital in business in the state. To assist in such matters is essential to the industrial development of the state. In making these determinations, the Legislature has considered and affirmatively expresses its policy to assist businesses, acknowledging that this determination has and will affect competition.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is hereby further declared that all of the foregoing are public purposes and will serve a public purpose in that they will promote industry, develop trade and increase employment opportunities for the benefit of the inhabitants of the state, either through the increase of commerce or through the promotion of safety, health, welfare, convenience or prosperity; and that the necessity of enacting the provisions herein set forth is in the public interest and is hereby so declared as a matter of express legislative determination.

      The share of the company shall not exceed ninety percent (90%) of the total principal amount of any such loan, and such participation shall be payable with interest at the same times, but not necessarily at the same interest rate, as the share of the lender, and both shares shall be equally and ratably secured by a valid mortgage on, or security interest in, real or personal property or by any other security satisfactory to the company to secure payment of the loan; however, the company’s share of any such loan may equal one hundred percent (100%) of the total principal amount of the business loan if the lender participating in the making or purchasing of such business loan by servicing the loan, purchased one hundred percent (100%) of the total amount of the bonds issued by the company in connection with or allocable to such business loan;

      Loaned from available funds which are not proceeds received directly from the sale of the company’s bonds and are not restricted under the terms of the resolution authorizing, or the indenture securing, such bonds; or
     </p>
     <p>
      Insured or guaranteed by a federal agency or by a private insurer qualified to write such insurance in the state, insuring a percentage of any claim for loss at least equal to that percentage of the value by which the business loan exceeds ninety percent (90%) thereof;
     </p>
     <p>
      The value of the property securing the business loan is certified by the participating lender, on the basis of such appraisals, bids, purchase orders and engineers’ certificates as the company may require; provided that the value of items purchased and constructed from the proceeds of the business loan shall not be deemed, for purposes of this section, to exceed the contract price in respect of purchase or construction;
     </p>
     <p>
      The company shall not disburse funds under a commitment to participate in a business loan for the construction or substantial improvement of property until the construction or improvement has been completed, unless a lender furnishes an irrevocable letter of credit or a qualified corporate surety furnishes payment and performance bonds, in either event satisfactory to the company and in an aggregate amount equal to the cost of such construction or improvement;
     </p>
     <p>
      No other indebtedness may be secured by a mortgage on, or security interest in, property securing a business loan made or purchased pursuant to this section without the prior express written authorization of the company; and
     </p>
     <p>
      The participating lender agrees to use the proceeds of the business loan to lend to eligible businesses in the state.

       § 57-10-305.
    Legislative findings and determinations.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The Legislature finds and determines as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      There exists a serious problem in the state regarding the ability of nonestablished farmers to acquire agricultural land and agricultural improvements and depreciable agricultural property in order to enter farming.
     </p>
     <p>
      This barrier to entry into farming is conducive to consolidation of acreage of agricultural land with fewer individuals resulting in a grave threat to the traditional family farm.
     </p>
     <p>
      These conditions result in a loss in population, unemployment and a movement of persons from rural communities to urban areas accompanied by added costs to communities for creation of new public facilities and services.
     </p>
     <p>
      One major cause of this condition has been recurrent shortages of funds in private channels and the high interest cost of borrowing.
     </p>
     <p>
      These shortages and costs have made the sale and purchase of agricultural land to beginning farmers a virtual impossibility in many parts of the state.
     </p>
     <p>
      The ordinary operations of private enterprise have not in the past corrected these conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      A stable supply of adequate funds for agricultural financing is required to encourage beginning farmers in an orderly and sustained manner and to reduce the problems described in this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is necessary that the corporation be given the authority to encourage ownership of farms by beginning farmers by providing purchase money loans to beginning farmers who are not able to obtain adequate capital elsewhere to provide such funds and to lower costs through the use of public financing.

       The corporation shall develop a beginning farmer loan program to facilitate the acquisition of agricultural land and improvements and depreciable agricultural property by beginning farmers.

The corporation may provide by rule the grounds for permitted assumptions of a mortgage or for the leasing, sale or other conveyance of any interest in the agricultural land or improvements. However, the corporation shall provide and state in a mortgage or secured loan that the corporation has the power to raise the interest rate of the loan to the prevailing market rate if the mortgage or secured loan is assumed by a farmer who is already established in that field at the time of the assumption of the loan.

    Financing agreements [Repealed effective October 1, 2022].
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      [In cases involving an economic development project for which the Mississippi Business Finance Corporation has issued bonds for the purpose of financing the approved costs of such project prior to July 1, 1994, this section shall read as follows:]
     </p>
     <p>
      The corporation may enter into, with any approved company, a financing agreement with respect to its economic development project. The terms and provisions of each financing agreement shall be determined by negotiations between the corporation and the approved company, except that each financing agreement shall include the following provisions:
     </p>
     <p>
      If the corporation issues any bonds in connection with an economic development project, the term of the financing agreement shall not be less than the last maturity of the bonds issued with respect to the economic development project, except that the financing agreement may terminate upon the earlier redemption of all of the bonds issued with respect to the economic development project and may grant to the approved company an option to purchase the economic development project from the corporation upon the termination of the financing agreement for such consideration and under such terms and conditions the corporation may approve. Nothing in this paragraph shall limit the extension of the term of a financing agreement if there is a refunding of the correlative bonds or otherwise.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the corporation issues any bonds in connection with an economic development project, the financing agreement shall specify that the annual obligations of the approved company under Sections 57-10-401 through 57-10-445 shall equal in each year at least the annual debt service for that year on the bonds issued with respect to the economic development project; and the approved company shall pay such obligation of the financing agreement to the trustee for bonds issued for the benefit of the approved company, at such time and in such amounts sufficient to amortize such bonds.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the corporation loans funds to an approved company that is a private company under the Mississippi Small Enterprise Development Finance Act, the financing agreement shall include the terms and conditions of the loan required by Section 57-71-1 et seq.
     </p>
     <p>
      (i) In consideration for financing agreement payment, the approved company may be permitted the following during the period of time in which the financing agreement is in effect, not to exceed twenty-five (25) years:
     </p>
     <p>
      1. A tax credit on the amount provided for in Section 27-7-22.3(2), Mississippi Code of 1972; plus
     </p>
     <p>
      2. The aggregate assessment withheld by the approved company in each year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The income tax credited to the approved company referred to herein shall be credited in the fiscal year of the financing agreement in which the tax return of the approved company is filed. The approved company shall not be required to pay estimated tax payments under Section 27-7-319, Mississippi Code of 1972.
     </p>
     <p>
      (i) The financing agreement shall provide that the assessments, when added to the credit for the state corporate income tax herein granted, shall not exceed the total financing agreement annual payment by the approved company in any year; however, to the extent that financing agreement annual payments exceed credits received and assessments collected in any year, the excess payment may be recouped from excess credits or assessment collections in succeeding years.
     </p>
     <p>
      If during any fiscal year of the financing agreement the total of the income tax credit granted to the approved company plus the assessment collected from the wages of the employees equals the annual payment pursuant to the financing agreement, and if all excess payments pursuant to the financing agreement accumulated in prior years have been recouped, the assessment collected from the wages of the employees shall cease for the remainder of the fiscal year of the financing agreement.
     </p>
     <p>
      The financing agreement shall provide that:
     </p>
     <p>
      It may be assigned by the approved company only upon the prior written consent of the corporation following the adoption of a resolution by the corporation to such effect; and
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon the default by the approved company in the obligation to render its annual payment, the corporation shall have the right, at its option, to declare the financing agreement in default and to accelerate the total of all annual payments that are to be made or to terminate the financing agreement and cause to be sold the economic development project at public or private sale, or to pursue any other remedies available under the Uniform Commercial Code, as from time to time amended, or otherwise available in law or equity.

       § 57-10-511.
    Grants of funds by MDA.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      MDA shall grant funds under this article to a planning and development district or qualified entity in accordance with the following terms and conditions:
     </p>
     <p>
      Grant funds received by a planning and development district or qualified entity in accordance with this article shall be used by the planning and development district or qualified entity to establish a revolving assistance fund for the purpose of providing assistance to small businesses in accordance with this article. Except as otherwise allowed in this article, all principal and interest payments by small businesses in repayment of such assistance shall be eligible for and used by the planning and development district or qualified entity for additional assistance to small businesses in accordance with this article.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each planning and development district meeting the criteria set forth in this article shall receive an initial grant of not to exceed One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) for the purpose of establishing the program within its area in accordance with this article. Each qualified entity meeting the criteria set forth in this article shall be eligible to receive an initial grant of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000.00) for the purpose of establishing the program within the area it serves in accordance with this article. The total amount of initial grants to planning and development districts shall not exceed Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000.00) and the total amount of initial grants for qualified entities shall not exceed Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000.00). Each planning and development district or qualified entity receiving an initial grant shall have twelve (12) months in which to make binding commitments to provide assistance to small businesses in the principal amount of the initial grant in accordance with this article. Grant funds not committed to provide assistance to small businesses at the end of twelve (12) months after receipt thereof by the planning and development district or qualified entity shall be returned to MDA for placement in a pool to be redistributed by MDA to planning and development districts or qualified entities which have binding commitments to distribute as assistance all their initial grant funds and have pending applications for additional assistance in accordance with this article. Any planning and development district or qualified entity returning any such grant funds to MDA shall be required at the time such initial grant funds are returned to deliver to the State Treasury, for deposit in the General Fund, interest on the amount of such returned funds at the same rate as any bonds or notes of the State of Mississippi issued pursuant to this article to provide such grant funds.
     </p>
     <p>
      After all of the initial grant funds have been provided as assistance to small businesses in accordance with this article, MDA shall distribute additional grant funds to each planning and development district or qualified entity qualified under this article to receive and requesting such funds in whatever amounts MDA deems appropriate and when needed by such planning and development districts or qualified entities to provide additional assistance to small businesses in accordance with this article. The schedule for distributing such funds shall be determined by MDA. Funds distributed to planning and development districts and qualified entities pursuant to this paragraph shall be in addition to funds distributed to planning and development districts and qualified entities pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section. The total amount of grants issued pursuant to this paragraph shall not exceed Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000.00) for planning and development districts or qualified entities. Grant funds not committed to provide assistance to small businesses at the end of twelve (12) months after receipt thereof by the planning and development district or qualified entity shall be returned to MDA for placement in a pool to be redistributed by MDA to planning and development districts or qualified entities which have binding commitments to distribute as assistance all their initial grant funds and have pending applications for additional assistance in accordance with this article. Any planning and development district or qualified entity returning any such grant funds to MDA shall be required at the time such grant funds are returned to deliver to the State Treasury, for deposit in the General Fund, interest on the amount of such returned funds at the same rate as any bonds or notes of the State of Mississippi issued pursuant to this article to provide such grant funds.
     </p>
     <p>
      A planning and development district or qualified entity participating in the program may utilize an amount equal to not more than fifty percent (50%) of interest earned on assistance provided to small businesses in accordance with this article or three percent (3%) of the current annual loans disbursed, whichever is the lesser amount, for administration and management of the program, unless specifically authorized to utilize more by MDA; however, any interest earned on grant funds held by a planning and development district or qualified entity prior to the utilization of such grant funds to provide assistance to small businesses shall be placed in the revolving assistance fund of the planning and development district or qualified entity and shall not be expended for administration or management costs. Planning and development districts and qualified entities may retain an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the interest earned on repayment funds that are being held on deposit in anticipation of relending, or three percent (3%) of the current annual loans disbursed, whichever is the lesser amount, to aid in the administration and management of the program. Each planning and development district and qualified entity shall file annually with the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives not later than the first day of each regular legislative session a report which details any interest retained or utilized by the planning and development district or qualified entity pursuant to this paragraph (d).
     </p>
     <p>
      If a planning and development district or qualified entity participating in the program experiences losses from assistance provided pursuant to the program in excess of sixty percent (60%) of the amount of grant funds received by the planning and development district or qualified entity, the planning and development district or qualified entity shall repay the State of Mississippi the amount of such losses in excess of sixty percent (60%) by delivering that amount to the State Treasury for deposit in the General Fund.
     </p>
     <p>
      MDA shall assist each planning and development district or qualified entity participating in the program in connection with such planning and development district’s or qualified entity’s compliance with this article.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each planning and development district or qualified entity participating in the program shall submit the following reports to the MDA:
     </p>
     <p>
      An annual audit of grant funds received in connection with the program; and
     </p>
     <p>
      A semiannual report on July 30 and January 30 of each year, describing all assistance provided to small businesses pursuant to the program, such reports to include without limitation the following: a description of each small business receiving assistance; the project to be assisted and purpose of assistance; a description of each loan and equity investment, including the terms and conditions thereof and use of the assistance funds by the small business; history of the assistance pool, including principal amount loaned, interest earned, interest expended for administration and management, principal amount of equity investments, assistance funds available, and losses; and a statement of jobs created or retained as a result of the assistance program.
     </p>
     <p>
      If MDA determines that a district or entity has provided assistance to small businesses in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of this article, then the amount of such assistance so provided shall be withheld by MDA from any additional grant funds to which the district or entity becomes entitled under this article. If MDA determines, after notifying such district or entity twice in writing and providing such district or entity a reasonable opportunity to comply, that a planning and development district or qualified entity has consistently failed to comply with this article in connection with the program, MDA may declare such planning and development district or qualified entity in default under the program and, upon receipt of notice thereof from MDA, such planning and development district or qualified entity shall immediately cease providing assistance under the program, shall refund to MDA for distribution to other planning and development districts or qualified entities all funds held in its revolving assistance fund and, if required by MDA, shall convey to MDA all administrative and management control of assistance provided by it under the program.
     </p>
     <p>
      If MDA determines, after notifying a planning and development district or qualified entity twice in writing and providing copies of such notification to each member of the Legislature in whose district or in a part of whose district such planning and development district or qualified entity is located and providing such district or entity a reasonable opportunity to take corrective action, that a planning and development district or a qualified entity administering a revolving assistance fund under the provisions of this article is not actively engaged in lending as defined by the rules and regulations of MDA, MDA may declare such planning and development district or qualified entity in default under the program and, upon receipt of notice thereof from MDA, such planning and development district or qualified entity shall immediately cease providing assistance under the program, shall refund to MDA for distribution to other planning and development districts or qualified entities all funds held in its revolving assistance fund and, if required by MDA, shall convey to MDA all administrative and management control of assistance provided by it under the program.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding any other provision of this article to the contrary, if federal funds are not available for commitments made by a planning and development district to provide assistance under any federal loan program administered by the planning and development district in coordination with the Appalachian Regional Commission or Economic Development Administration, or both, a planning and development district may use funds in its revolving assistance fund, which have not been committed otherwise to provide assistance, for the purpose of providing temporary funding for such commitments. If a planning and development district uses uncommitted funds in its revolving assistance fund to provide such temporary funding, the district shall use funds repaid to the district under the temporarily funded federal loan program to replenish the funds used to provide the temporary funding. Funds used by a planning and development district to provide temporary funding under this paragraph (j) must be repaid to the district’s revolving assistance fund no later than twelve (12) months after the date the district provides the temporary funding. A planning and development district may not use uncommitted funds in its revolving assistance fund to provide temporary funding under this paragraph (j) on more than two (2) occasions during a calendar year. A planning and development district may provide temporary funding for multiple commitments on each such occasion. The maximum aggregate amount of uncommitted funds in a revolving assistance fund that may be used for such purposes during a calendar year shall not exceed seventy percent (70%) of the uncommitted funds in the revolving assistance fund on the date the district first provides temporary funding during the calendar year.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The Legislature finds the following:
     </p>
     <p>
      Developing quality retail food outlets creates jobs, expands markets for Mississippi farmers, and supports economic vitality in underserved communities.
     </p>
     <p>
      Increasing access to retail food outlets that sell fresh fruits, vegetables and other healthy food is an important strategy for fighting the obesity epidemic and improving health. Studies have shown that people with better access to supermarkets and fresh produce tend to have healthier diets and lower levels of obesity.
     </p>
     <p>
      The program established under this article is intended to provide a dedicated source of financing for healthy food retailers operating in underserved communities in Mississippi, in both urban and rural areas; to increase access to affordable healthy food so as to improve diets and health; to promote the sale and consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables, in natural and/or frozen form, particularly those that are Mississippi grown; and to support expanded economic opportunities in low-income and rural communities.

However, the Mississippi Agricultural and Industrial Board shall inform such individuals or group of individuals desiring to make use of such plans, specifications and other information that the cost of the actual design, engineering and other work connected with each proposed plant, but not the cost of the special market research, has come from a revolving fund established by the Mississippi Legislature under Sections 57-11-31 through 57-11-39, and that the cost of such plant engineering services must be included by such individuals or group of individuals in the total cost of the new plant and the amount repaid to the state treasurer, to be placed in the said revolving fund, and thereby made available to pay for the cost of additional engineering and other services in connection with the design of plants for the use by other individuals. The Mississippi Agricultural and Industrial Board, after having investigated and confirmed the financial responsibility of the applicant, shall require each individual or group of individuals building a plant by the plans and specifications so provided to enter into a valid, legal and binding obligation to repay the cost of such plant engineering to the “plant engineering revolving fund” maintained in the state treasury, in an amount each year and over a period of years to be fixed by the said board in its discretion. If the individual or group of individuals building a plant by the plans and specifications so provided shall enter into a contract with any municipality for the construction of a plant from the proceeds of bonds to be issued under the provisions of Sections 57-1-1 through 57-1-51, known as the “Balance Agriculture With Industry Law,” then the cost of such plant engineering shall be included as a part of the initial cost of the building and shall be repaid to the state treasurer from the proceeds of the sale of said bonds.

       Chapter 518 of laws of 1988 abolished any property right that may have existed in favor of plaintiffs, who held positions in Department of Economic Development, in continued employment with Department, regardless of whether any such property right previously existed. State may amend or terminate property interests that it has created, such as employment programs and causes of action, without depriving affected individuals of procedural due process. When state extinguishes, through legislation, property interests, it is said that “legislative determination provides all the process that is due.” Buford v. Holladay, 791 F.

The report shall also explain the policy purposes for each such tax expenditure provision and may show any indicators of effectiveness or ineffectiveness in achieving such policy purposes. If the Director of the University Research Center determines that preparation of such report shall adversely affect in a material manner any work or projects of the center which are being performed by staff persons preparing the report required by this section, the director may request the Legislative Budget Committee to reduce the requirements of this section as to the contents of the report for one (1) year, but in no event shall the report contain less than the dollar amount of each such tax expenditure required to be included therein.

      These various tax incentives and economic development programs are intended as a tool for economic development, promoting new jobs and business growth in Mississippi;
     </p>
     <p>
      The state needs a systematic approach for evaluating whether incentives are fulfilling their intended purposes in a cost-effective manner;
     </p>
     <p>
      In order to improve state government’s effectiveness in serving the residents of this state, the Legislature finds it necessary to provide for the systematic and comprehensive analysis of economic development tax incentives and economic development programs, and for those analyses to be incorporated into the budget and policymaking processes.

       In recognition of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, as amended, the council is directed to prepare and implement a coastal program that establishes guidelines and procedures pursuant to the following goals:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t57c15s57-15-6ol11a">
         To provide for reasonable industrial expansion in the coastal area and to insure the efficient utilization of waterfront industrial sites so that suitable sites are conserved for water dependent industry;

       It is the intent of the Legislature that the coastal program described in subsection (1) of this section should comprise a statement of consolidated state policy in the coastal area, incorporating all applicable constitutional provisions, laws and regulations of the State of Mississippi. Where the coastal program includes provisions that are otherwise under the jurisdiction of another state agency, the coastal program shall not conflict with such agency’s jurisdiction.

       In addition to the powers and duties now conferred upon them by law, all state agencies shall carry out their responsibilities in the coastal area in compliance with the coastal program described in subsection (1) of this section unless otherwise prohibited by law. The coastal program shall include procedures by which conflicts between state agencies concerning their compliance with the coastal program may be resolved. Further, the council shall establish in the program procedures to review and coordinate any decisions affecting the coastal area so that all state agencies and other interested parties will have the opportunity to participate in such decisions.

It is the intent of the legislature that one-stop permitting shall expedite the decision making of all governmental entities having separate regulatory jurisdiction or authority over activities in the coastal area without impinging on the regulatory jurisdiction or authority of these governmental entities.
       <p>
        One-stop permitting shall be implemented by means of the agreements authorized in subsection (4) of Section 57-15-5, and shall provide for the following:

The council shall include in this plan provisions for the disposal of spoil material from dredging operations. In designating suitable sites for water dependent industry, the council shall consider the nature and extent of specific alterations that would serve a higher public interest pursuant to the development of these sites.

    Organization.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The laboratory shall be organized as necessary to properly conduct the program responsibilities and purposes outlined generally in Section 57-21-9 and specifically stated in various state laws. A minimum of four (4) divisions as described below is authorized; extra major divisions needed to organize the laboratory work may be established by the State Chemist.
     </p>
     <p>
      Chemical Regulatory Division – This division shall carry out regulatory control programs in food, animal feeds, fertilizers, economic poisons, paints and varnishes, and similar programs legally authorized.
     </p>
     <p>
      Petroleum Products Division – This division shall conduct testing on petroleum and related products. Any person desiring testing of petroleum and related products shall pay to the State Chemist the actual cost of such testing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Industrial and Agricultural Services Division – This division shall provide applied scientific and engineering consultation to industries and individuals residing in or doing business in the state. Such services might include, among other things, chemical or physical analyses, nondestructive or destructive physical testing, bacteriological examinations and tests, on-site examinations of problems, sampling and limited quality control analyses, research, or other activities related to the improvement of processes, products, or raw materials. Such analyses or examinations will be directed towards solutions of problems of state industries, farmers, or citizens. The laboratory may charge for its services at established prices or may negotiate with the client for a service, consultation, or research contract at terms agreeable to the client and the State Chemist.
     </p>
     <p>
      The guiding principle in such services shall be that they contribute to the economic growth and development of Mississippi or to the welfare of its citizens, and that major projects shall be self-supporting but nonprofit.
     </p>
     <p>
      This division may perform such services using its own resources, or it may arrange for additional technical aid, consultation by other university faculty members, and use of facilities, services, or equipment of other university departments on a reimbursement basis. Any such arrangement shall always be established with the approval of the university administration.
     </p>
     <p>
      Agricultural analyses for individual citizens may be charged on a cost basis. Fees for services shall be established by regulations by the State Chemist.
     </p>
     <p>
      Services may be provided to other state agencies on an equivalent-cost exchange basis. The agency shall be invoiced for the cost of services as negotiated between the laboratory and the agency. Any special equipment required to conduct such services shall be a part of the assessed charge.
     </p>
     <p>
      All such services of this division may be made available to any state agency, firm, or individual only as far as personnel, funds, and equipment permit. The division reserves the right to refuse any services which interfere with other functions of the laboratory or which may generate a conflict of interest.
     </p>
     <p>
      Research Division – This division shall conduct self-supported, grant, or contract research. This research is directed toward problem solving, having immediate or potential influence on the economic growth and promotion of agriculture or industry in Mississippi, or improvement of the laboratory’s analytical capabilities in support of its current or anticipated future regulatory functions. The division is authorized to apply for, negotiate for payment, and conduct research on grants or contracts from federal and state agencies, industrial firms, and individuals or groups of individuals.

    Adoption and terms of compact.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The Southern States Energy Compact is hereby enacted into law and entered into by this state with any and all states legally joining therein in accordance with its terms, in the form substantially as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      Article I. Policy and Purpose
     </p>
     <p>
      The party states recognize that the proper employment and conservation of energy and employment of energy-related facilities, materials and products, within the context of a responsible regard for the environment, can assist substantially in the industrialization of the south and the development of a balanced economy for the region. They also recognize that optimum benefit from an acquisition of energy resources and facilities requires systematic encouragement, guidance and assistance from the party states on a cooperative basis. It is the policy of the party states to undertake such cooperation on a continuing basis; it is the purpose of this compact to provide the instruments and framework for such a cooperative effort to improve the economy of the South and contribute to the individual and community well-being of the region’s people.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article II. The Board
     </p>
     <p>
      There is hereby created an agency of the party states to be known as the “Southern States Energy Board” (hereinafter called the board). The board shall be composed of three (3) members from each party state. One (1) member shall be appointed by the Governor, one (1) member shall be appointed by the lieutenant governor from the state senate, and one (1) member shall be appointed by the speaker of the house from the house of representatives. Each member shall be designated or appointed in accordance with the law of the state which he represents and serving and subject to removal in accordance with such law. Such appointees shall serve at the will and pleasure of the person making the appointment. Any member of the legislature appointed under the provisions of this article shall not serve beyond the expiration of his term of office. Any member of the board may provide for the discharge of his duties and the performance of his functions thereon (either for the duration of his membership or for any lesser period of time) by a deputy or assistant, if the laws of his state make specific provision therefor. The federal government may be represented without vote if provision is made by federal law for such representation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each party state shall be entitled to one (1) vote on the board, to be determined by majority vote of each member or member’s representative from the party state present and voting on any question. No action of the board shall be binding unless taken at a meeting at which a majority of all party states are represented, and unless a majority of the total number of votes on the board is cast in favor thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board shall have a seal.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board shall elect annually, from among its members, a chairman, a vice chairman and a treasurer. The board shall appoint an executive director who shall serve at its pleasure and who shall also act as secretary, and who, together with the treasurer, shall be bonded in such amounts as the board may require.
     </p>
     <p>
      The executive director, with the approval of the board, shall appoint and remove or discharge such personnel as may be necessary for the performance of the board’s functions irrespective of the civil service, personnel or other merit system laws of any of the party states.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board may establish and maintain, independently or in conjunction with any one or more of the party states, a suitable retirement system for its full-time employees. Employees of the board shall be eligible for social security coverage in respect of old age and survivors insurance provided that the board takes such steps as may be necessary pursuant to federal law to participate in such program of insurance as a governmental agency or unit. The board may establish and maintain or participate in such additional programs of employee benefits as may be appropriate.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board may borrow, accept or contract for the services of personnel from any state or the United States or any subdivision or agency thereof, from any interstate agency, or from any institution, person, firm or corporation.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board may accept for any of its purposes and functions under this compact any and all donations and grants of money, equipment, supplies, materials and services (conditional or otherwise) from any state or the United States or any subdivision or agency thereof, or interstate agency, or from any institution, person, firm or corporation, and may receive, utilize and dispose of the same.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board may establish and maintain such facilities as may be necessary for the transacting of its business. The board may acquire, hold and convey real and personal property and any interest therein.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board shall adopt bylaws, rules and regulations for the conduct of its business, and shall have the power to amend and rescind these bylaws, rules and regulations. The board shall publish its bylaws, rules and regulations in convenient form and shall file a copy thereof, and shall also file a copy of any amendment thereto, with the appropriate agency or officer in each of the party states.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board annually shall make to the Governor of each party state, a report covering the activities of the board for the preceding year, and embodying such recommendations as may have been adopted by the board, which report shall be transmitted to the legislature of said state. The board may issue such additional reports as it may deem desirable.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article III. Finances
     </p>
     <p>
      The board shall submit to the executive head or designated officer or officers of each party state a budget of its estimated expenditures for such period as may be required by the laws of that jurisdiction for presentation to the legislature thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each of the board’s budgets of estimated expenditures shall contain specific recommendations of the amount or amounts to be appropriated by each of the party states. One-half (1/2) of the total amount of each budget of estimated expenditures shall be apportioned among the party states in equal shares; one-fourth (1/4) of each such budget shall be apportioned among the party states in accordance with the ratio of their populations to the total population of the entire group of party states based on the last decennial federal census; and one-fourth (1/4) of each such budget shall be apportioned among the party states on the basis of the relative average per capita income of the inhabitants in each of the party states based on the latest computations published by the federal census-taking agency. Subject to appropriation by their respective legislatures, the board shall be provided with such funds by each of the party states as are necessary to provide the means of establishing and maintaining facilities, a staff of personnel, and such activities as may be necessary to fulfill the powers and duties imposed upon and entrusted to the board.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board may meet any of its obligations in whole or in part with funds available to it under article II(h) of this compact, provided that the board takes specific action setting aside such funds prior to the incurring of any obligation to be met in whole or in part in this manner. Except where the board makes use of funds available to it under article II(h) hereof, the board shall not incur any obligation prior to the allotment of funds by the party jurisdictions adequate to meet the same.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the board shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its bylaws. However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the board shall be audited yearly by a qualified public accountant and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the board.
     </p>
     <p>
      The accounts of the board shall be open at any reasonable time for inspection.

         There is created in the State Treasury a special fund to be known as the “Tourism Project Sales Tax Incentive Fund,” into which shall be deposited such money as provided in Section 27-65-75(16). The monies in the fund shall be used for the purpose of making the incentive payments authorized in this section. The fund shall be administered by the MDA. Unexpended amounts remaining in the fund at the end of a fiscal year shall not lapse into the State General Fund, and any interest earned on or investment earnings on the amounts in the fund shall be deposited to the credit of the fund. The MDA may use not more than one percent (1%) of interest earned or investment earnings, or both, on amounts in the fund for administration and management of the incentive program authorized under Sections 57-26-1 through 57-26-5.

      The authority shall have power and is hereby authorized with the approval and consent of the board of supervisors of such county, at one time or from time to time, to provide by resolution for the issuance of negotiable promissory notes or revenue bonds of the authority to provide funds for the purpose of paying all or any part of the cost of any project authorized by this chapter, but in no event shall the amount of such bonds issued for any project exceed the estimated cost of any such project nor shall the amount of such bonds exceed the amount which can be repaid, together with interest accruing thereon, from funds pledged to said authority under Section 27-39-329. The principal of and the interest on such revenue bonds shall be payable solely from a special fund to be provided for that purpose in the manner hereinafter set forth. Such bonds shall bear date or dates, be in such denomination or denominations, bear interest at such rate or rates, be payable at such place or places within or without the State of Mississippi, shall mature absolutely at such time or times, be redeemable prior to maturity at such time or times and upon such terms, with or without premium, shall bear such registration privileges, and shall be substantially in such form, all as shall be determined by resolution of the authority; however, such bonds shall mature in annual installments extending not more than thirty (30) years from date thereof. Such bonds shall be signed by the president of the authority, or by his facsimile signature, and the official seal of the authority shall be affixed thereto, attested by the secretary of the authority. The interest coupons, if any, to be attached to such bonds may be executed by the facsimile signatures of said officers. Whenever any such bonds shall have been signed by the officials herein designated to sign the bonds who were in office at the time of such signing but who may have ceased to be such officers prior to the sale and delivery of such bonds, or who may not have been in office on the date such bonds may bear, the signatures of such officers upon such bonds and coupons shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes and have the same effect as if the person so officially signing such bonds had remained in office until the delivery of the same to purchaser or had been in office on the date such bonds may bear. Prior to approval being granted by the board for bonds to be issued by the authority, the board shall comply with the provisions of Section 19-9-11. The bonds of any issue shall not bear a greater overall maximum interest rate to maturity than that allowed in Section 75-17-103. No bond shall bear more than one (1) rate of interest; each bond shall bear interest from its date to its stated maturity date at the interest rate specified in the bid; all bonds of the same maturity shall bear the same rate of interest from date to maturity; all interest accruing on such bonds so issued shall be payable semiannually or annually, except that the first interest coupon attached to any such bond may be for any period not exceeding one (1) year.
     </p>
     <p>
      No interest payment shall be evidenced by more than one (1) coupon and neither cancelled nor supplemental coupons shall be permitted; the lowest interest rate specified for any bonds issued shall not be less than seventy percent (70%) of the highest interest rate specified for the same bond issue.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each interest rate specified in any bid must be in multiples of one-eighth of one percent (1/8 of 1%) or in multiples of one-tenth of one percent (1/10 of 1%). The denomination, form, and place, or places, of payment of such bonds shall be fixed in the resolution or order of the authority issuing such bonds.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition to the other powers and authority granted by this section, the authority is granted the authority, with the approval and consent of the board of supervisors of the county, to provide by resolution for the issuance of a negotiable promissory note in an amount not to exceed Fifteen Million Dollars ($15,000,000.00) to provide funds for a project described in Section 57-75-5(f)(xxii) provided the authority makes a finding that the promissory note will be paid by bonds issued by the board of supervisors of the county. Compliance with the notice provisions of Section 19-9-11 shall not be required for the approval of such promissory note.

     <p>
      The board of supervisors of each county electing to be a part of this council is authorized to set aside, appropriate and expend moneys from the general fund for the purpose of securing funds with which to support and maintain said council. Prior to the board of supervisors securing an indebtedness of the council under this chapter, the board shall comply with the provisions of Section 19-9-11. Provided, however, any tax levied previously under Section 19-9-111 by any county may be collected and paid to the council created hereby if such tax has not already been paid to the appropriate industrial council. Provided further, that the board of supervisors of any such participating county may, by appropriate order, designate a specific portion of the sum of its appropriation, not to exceed the revenue derived from three-fourths (3/4) of one (1) mill, to be used by said council exclusively for industrial development of said county in any manner authorized by this chapter. The council is hereby authorized to receive and expend funds from the boards of supervisors of participating counties provided by taxation as aforesaid, together with any gifts, gratuities and donations from municipalities within any participating county and from any persons, firms or corporations desiring to make such donations. Such appropriations, gifts or donations shall be placed in such depository as the council may deem appropriate. Any funds designated by any county board of supervisors or the governing body of a municipality for exclusive use within said county shall not be commingled with any other funds, but shall be kept and expended separately.

      The State of Mississippi shall adhere to the Southern Growth Policies Agreement by becoming a party state therein in the form substantially as follows:

     <p>
      SOUTHERN GROWTH POLICIES AGREEMENT
     </p>
     <p>
      Article I. Findings and Purposes
     </p>
     <p>
      The party states find that the South has a sense of community based on common social, cultural and economic needs, and fostered by a regional tradition. There are vast potentialities for mutual improvement of each state in the region by cooperative planning for the development, conservation and efficient utilization of human and natural resources in a geographic area large enough to afford a high degree of flexibility in identifying and taking maximum advantage of opportunities for healthy and beneficial growth. The independence of each state and the special needs of subregions are recognized and are to be safeguarded. Accordingly, the cooperation resulting from this agreement is intended to assist the states in meeting their own problems by enhancing their abilities to recognize and analyze regional opportunities and take account of regional influences in planning and implementing their public policies.
     </p>
     <p>
      The purposes of this agreement are to provide:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t57c33s57-33-1ol11">
       Improve facilities and procedures for study, analysis and planning of governmental policies, programs and activities of regional significance.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c33s57-33-1ol12">
       Assistance in the prevention of interstate conflicts and the promotion of regional cooperation.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c33s57-33-1ol13">
       Mechanisms for the coordination of state and local interests on a regional basis.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c33s57-33-1ol14">

If a study or investigation that would be of primary benefit to a given state, unit of local government, or intrastate or interstate area is proposed, and if the board finds that it is not justified in undertaking the work for its regional value as a demonstration, the board may undertake the study or investigation as a special project. In any such event, it shall be a condition precedent that satisfactory financing and personnel arrangements be concluded to assure that the party or parties benefited bear all costs which the board determines that it would be inequitable for it to assume. Prior to undertaking any study or investigation pursuant to this article as a special project, the board shall make reasonable efforts to secure the undertaking of the work by another responsible public or private entity in accordance with the policy set forth in Article IV(b).

Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to deny the availability for use in the preparation of any such plan of data and information already in the possession of the board or to require payment on account of the use thereof in addition to payments otherwise required to be made pursuant to other provisions of this agreement.

       § 57-43-11.
    Agreements to jointly fund rehabilitation or improvement; loans to make up local share.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The Executive Director of the Mississippi Department of Transportation, with the approval of the Mississippi Transportation Commission, may enter into agreements for the purposes of this chapter whereby the state shall provide, from the state portion of the funds available, not more than seventy-five percent (75%) of the amounts necessary to rehabilitate or improve a rail line or segment thereof which has been documented as being viable and cost-effective, provided at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the cost is provided by federal, local, user or railroad funds. The portion to be provided by local governmental agencies may be in the form of a loan from the Railroad Revitalization Fund, with repayment being made by a portion of the revenue derived from the improved line or by a pledge of certain other funds. Any loan shall be made at no interest, provided payments are made in accordance with the agreement. Any portion of a loan outstanding during any delinquency shall bear interest at the legal rate on the entire balance due. In the event that a loan made to a county or municipality has not been repaid or arrangements satisfactory to the Mississippi Transportation Department have not been made to repay the loan within a period of time after same is due and payable, as determined by the department, the department shall determine that there is a default, shall enter an order to that effect upon its official minutes, and send a certified copy of said order by certified mail, postage prepaid, to the chancery clerk or city clerk, as the case may be. If said default is not satisfied in full within thirty (30) days following notification of default by the department, the county or municipality, as the case may be, shall forfeit its right to receive reimbursement for homestead exemption until such time as its indebtedness has been discharged or arrangements to discharge said indebtedness satisfactory to the department have been made. Homestead exemption funds forfeited hereby shall, upon demand by the department made in writing upon the Mississippi State Tax Commission, be paid to the Mississippi Transportation Department and applied to the discharge of the obligation.

       There is created a special fund in the State Treasury to be designated as the “Local Governments Freight Rail Service Project Revolving Loan Fund,” which fund shall consist of such monies as provided in Sections 57-44-11 through 57-44-39. The fund shall be maintained in perpetuity for the purposes established in this chapter. Unexpended amounts remaining in the fund at the end of a fiscal year shall not lapse into the State General Fund, and any interest earned on amounts in the fund shall be deposited to the credit of the fund. Monies in the fund may not be used or expended for any purpose except as authorized under this chapter. However, the Mississippi Development Authority, in order to promote the safety of the general public, shall establish a program to permit monies from the Local Governments Freight Rail Service Project Revolving Loan Fund to be provided to counties in the form of grants to assist counties in defraying expenses relating to the upgrading of railroad grade crossings. Only projects approved by the Mississippi Department of Transportation shall be eligible for such grants. The Mississippi Development Authority, by rule and regulation, shall establish the maximum amount of any grant awarded to a county and may establish such other rules and regulations as it deems appropriate or necessary to administer the grant program and ensure that monies in the fund are made available to all counties on an equitable basis. Federal funds shall be utilized to pay not less than five percent (5%) of the cost of each project.

      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The Southeast Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management Compact is hereby enacted into law and entered into by this state with any and all states legally joining therein in accordance with its terms, in the form substantially as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      Article I.
     </p>
     <p>
      Policy and Purpose
     </p>
     <p>
      There is hereby created the Southeast Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management Compact. The party states recognize and declare that each state is responsible for providing for the availability of capacity either within or outside the state for disposal of low-level radioactive waste generated within its borders, except for waste generated as a result of defense activities of the federal government or federal research and development activities. They also recognize that the management of low-level radioactive waste is handled most efficiently on a regional basis. The party states further recognize that the Congress of the United States, by enacting the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act (P.L. 96-573), has provided for and encourages the development of low-level radioactive waste compacts as a tool for disposal of such waste. The party states recognize that the safe and efficient management of low-level radioactive waste generated within the region requires that sufficient capacity to dispose of such waste be properly provided.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is the policy of the party states to: enter into a regional low-level radioactive waste management compact for the purpose of providing the instrument and framework for a cooperative effort, provide sufficient facilities for the proper management of low-level radioactive waste generated in the region, promote the health and safety of the region, limit the number of facilities required to effectively and efficiently manage low-level radioactive waste generated in the region, encourage the reduction of the amounts of low-level waste generated in the region, distribute the costs, benefits and obligations of successful low-level radioactive waste management equitably among the party states, and ensure the ecological and economical management of low-level radioactive wastes.
     </p>
     <p>
      Implicit in the congressional consent to this compact is the expectation by the Congress and the party states that the appropriate federal agencies will actively assist the compact commission and the individual party states to this compact by:
     </p>
     <p>
      1. Expeditious enforcement of federal rules, regulations and laws; and
     </p>
     <p>
      2. Imposing sanctions against those found to be in violation of federal rules, regulations and laws; and
     </p>
     <p>
      3. Timely inspection of their licensees to determine their capability to adhere to such rules, regulations and laws; and
     </p>
     <p>
      4. Timely provision of technical assistance to this compact in carrying out their obligations under the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act as amended.

     </p>
     <p>
      The rights granted to the party states by this compact are additional to the rights enjoyed by sovereign states, and nothing in this compact shall be construed to infringe upon, limit or abridge those rights.
     </p>
     <p>
      a. Subject to any license issued by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission or a host state, each party state shall have the right to have all wastes generated within its borders stored, treated or disposed of, as applicable, at regional facilities, and additionally shall have the right of access to facilities made available to the region through agreements entered into by the commission pursuant to Article IV(e)(9).

     </p>
     <p>
      b. If no operating regional facility is located within the borders of a party state and wastes generated within its borders must therefore be stored, treated, or disposed of at a regional facility in another party state, the party state without such facilities may be required by the host state or states to establish a mechanism which provides compensation for access to the regional facility according to terms and conditions established by the host state or states and approved by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of the commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      c. Each party state must establish the capability to regulate, license and ensure the maintenance and extended care of any facility within its borders. Host states are responsible for the availability, the subsequent post closure observation and maintenance, and the extended institutional control of their regional facilities, in accordance with the provisions of Article V(b).
     </p>
     <p>
      d. Each party state must establish the capability to enforce any applicable federal or state laws and regulations pertaining to the packaging and transportation of waste generated within or passing through its borders.
     </p>
     <p>
      e. Each party state must provide to the commission on an annual basis, any data and information necessary to the implementation of the commission’s responsibilities. Each party state shall establish the capability to obtain any data and information necessary to meet its obligation herein defined.
     </p>
     <p>
      f. Each party state must, to the extent authorized by federal law, require generators within its borders to use the best available waste management technologies and practices to minimize the volumes of wastes requiring disposal.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article IV.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Commission
     </p>
     <p>
      a. There is hereby created the Southeast Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management Commission, (“the commission” or “compact commission”). The commission shall consist of two (2) voting members from each party state to be appointed according to the laws of each state. The appointing authorities of each state must notify the commission in writing of the identity of its members and any alternates. An alternate may act on behalf of the member only in the member’s absence.
     </p>
     <p>
      b. Each commission member is entitled to one (1) vote. No action of the commission shall be binding unless a majority of the total membership cast their vote in the affirmative, or unless a greater than majority vote is specifically required by any other provision of this compact.
     </p>
     <p>
      c. The commission must elect from among its members a presiding officer. The commission shall adopt and publish, in convenient form, bylaws which are consistent with this compact.
     </p>
     <p>
      d. The commission must meet at least once a year and shall also meet upon the call of the presiding officer, by petition of a majority of the party states, or upon the call of a host state. All meetings of the commission must be open to the public.
     </p>
     <p>
      e. The commission has the following duties and powers:
     </p>
     <p>
      1. To receive and approve the application of a nonparty state to become an eligible state in accordance with Article VII(b); and
     </p>
     <p>
      2. To receive and approve the application of an eligible state to become a party state in accordance with Article VII(c); and
     </p>
     <p>
      3. To submit an annual report and other communications to the governors and to the presiding officer of each body of the legislature of the party states regarding the activities of the commission; and
     </p>
     <p>
      4. To develop and use procedures for determining, consistent with considerations for public health and safety, the type and number of regional facilities which are presently necessary and which are projected to be necessary to manage waste generated within the region; and
     </p>
     <p>
      5. To provide the party states with reference guidelines for establishing the criteria and procedures for evaluating alternative locations for emergency or permanent regional facilities; and
     </p>
     <p>
      6. To develop and adopt, within one (1) year after the commission is constituted as provided for in Article VII(d), procedures and criteria for identifying a party state as a host state for a regional facility as determined pursuant to the requirements of this article. In accordance with these procedures and criteria, the commission shall identify a host state for the development of a second regional disposal facility within three (3) years after the commission is constituted as provided for in Article VII(d) and shall seek to ensure that such facility is licensed and ready to operate as soon as required, but in no event later than 1991.
     </p>
     <p>
      7. In accordance with the procedures and criteria developed pursuant to Section (e)(6) of this article, to designate, by a two-thirds (2/3) vote, a host state for the establishment of a needed regional facility. The commission shall not exercise this authority unless the party states have failed to voluntarily pursue the development of such facility. The commission shall have the authority to revoke the membership of a party state that willfully creates barriers to the siting of a needed regional facility; and
     </p>
     <p>
      8. To require of and obtain from party states, eligible states seeking to become party states, and nonparty states seeking to become eligible states, data and information necessary to the implementation of commission responsibilities; and
     </p>
     <p>
      9. Notwithstanding any other provision of this compact, to enter into agreements with any person, state or similar regional body or group of states for the importation of waste into the region and for the right of access to facilities outside the region for waste generated within the region. The authorization to import requires a two-thirds (2/3) majority vote of the commission, including an affirmative vote of both representatives of a host state in which any affected regional facility is located. This shall be done only after an assessment of the affected facilities’ capability to handle such wastes; and
     </p>
     <p>
      10. To act or appear on behalf of any party state or states, only upon written request of both members of the commission for such state or states, as an intervenor or party in interest before Congress, state legislatures, any court of law, or any federal, state or local agency, board or commission which has jurisdiction over the management of wastes. The authority to act, intervene or otherwise appear shall be exercised by the commission only after approval by a majority vote of the commission; and
     </p>
     <p>
      11. To revoke the membership of a party state in accordance with Article VII(f).
     </p>
     <p>
      In developing criteria, the commission must consider the following: the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the party states; the existence of regional facilities within each party state; the minimization of waste transportation; the volumes and types of wastes generated within each party state; and the environmental, economic, and ecological impacts on the air, land and water resources of the party states.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission shall conduct such hearings, require such reports, studies, evidence and testimony; and do what is required by its approved procedures in order to identify a party state as a host state for a needed facility; and
     </p>
     <p>
      f. The commission may establish any advisory committees as it deems necessary for the purpose of advising the commission on any matters pertaining to the management of low-level radioactive waste.
     </p>
     <p>
      g. The commission may appoint or contract for and compensate a limited staff necessary to carry out its duties and functions. The staff shall serve at the commission’s pleasure irrespective of the civil service, personnel or other merit laws of any of the party states or the federal government and shall be compensated from funds of the commission. In selecting any staff, the commission shall assure that the staff has adequate experience and formal training to carry out such functions as may be assigned to it by the commission. If the commission has a headquarters it shall be in a party state.
     </p>
     <p>
      h. Funding for the commission shall be provided as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      1. Each eligible state, upon becoming a party state, shall pay Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) to the commission which shall be used for costs of the commission’s services.
     </p>
     <p>
      2. Each state hosting a regional disposal facility shall annually levy special fees or surcharges on all users of such facility, based upon the volume of wastes disposed of at such facilities, the total of which:
     </p>
     <p>
      Must be sufficient to cover the annual budget of the commission; and
     </p>
     <p>
      Must represent the financial commitments of all party states to the commission; and
     </p>
     <p>
      Must be paid to the commission, provided, however, that each host state collecting such fees or surcharges may retain a portion of the collection sufficient to cover its administrative costs of collection, and that the remainder be sufficient only to cover the approved annual budgets of the commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      3. The commission must set and approve its first annual budget as soon as practicable after its initial meeting. Host states for disposal facilities must begin imposition of the special fees and surcharges provided for in this section as soon as practicable after becoming party states, and must remit to the commission funds resulting from collection of such special fees and surcharges within sixty (60) days of their receipt.
     </p>
     <p>
      i. The commission must keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. An independent certified public accountant shall annually audit all receipts and disbursements of commission funds, and submit an audit report to the commission. Such audit report shall be made a part of the annual report of the commission required by Article IV(e)(3).
     </p>
     <p>
      j. The commission may accept for any of its purposes and functions any and all donations, grants of money, equipment, supplies, materials and services (conditional or otherwise) from any state or the United States or any subdivision or agency thereof, or interstate agency, or from any institution, person, firm or corporation, and may receive, utilize and dispose of the same. The nature, amount and condition, if any, attendant upon any donation or grant accepted pursuant to this paragraph together with the identity of the donor, grantor or lender, shall be detailed in the annual report of the commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      k. The commission is not responsible for any costs associated with (1) the creation of any facility, (2) the operation of any facility, (3) the stabilization and closure of any facility, (4) the postclosure observation, and maintenance of any facility, or (5) the extended institutional control, after postclosure observation and maintenance of any facility.
     </p>
     <p>
      As of January 1, 1986, the management of wastes at regional facilities is restricted to wastes generated within the region, and to wastes generated within nonparty states when authorized by the commission pursuant to the provisions of this compact. After January 1, 1986, the commission may prohibit the exportation of waste from the region for purposes of management.
     </p>
     <p>
      m. 1. The commission herein established is a legal entity separate and distinct from the party states, capable of acting in its own behalf, and is liable for its actions. Liabilities of the commission shall not be deemed liabilities of the party states. Members of the commission shall not be personally liable for actions taken by them in their official capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      2. Except as specifically provided in this compact, nothing in this compact shall be construed to alter the incidence of liability of any kind for any act, omission, course of conduct, or on account of any causal or other relationships. Generators, transporters of wastes, owners and operators of sites shall be liable for their acts, omissions, conduct, or relationships in accordance with all laws relating thereto.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article V.
     </p>
     <p>
      Development and Operation of Facilities
     </p>
     <p>
      a. Any party state which becomes a host state in which a regional facility is operated shall not be designated by the compact commission as a host state for an additional regional facility until each party state has fulfilled its obligation, as determined by the commission, to have a regional facility operated within its borders.
     </p>
     <p>
      b. A host state desiring to close a regional facility located within its borders may do so only after notifying the commission in writing of its intention to do so and the reasons therefor. Such notification shall be given to the commission at least four (4) years prior to the intended date of closure. Notwithstanding the four-year notice requirement herein provided, a host state is not prevented from closing its facility or establishing conditions of its use and operations as necessary for the protection of the health and safety of its citizens. A host state may terminate or limit access to its regional facility if it determines that Congress has materially altered the conditions of this compact.
     </p>
     <p>
      c. Each party state designated as a host state for a regional facility shall take appropriate steps to ensure that an application for a license to construct and operate a facility of the designated type is filed with and issued by the appropriate authority.
     </p>
     <p>
      d. No party state shall have any form of arbitrary prohibition on the treatment, storage or disposal of low-level radioactive waste within its borders.
     </p>
     <p>
      e. No party state shall be required to operate a regional facility for longer than a twenty-year period, or to dispose of more than thirty-two million (32,000,000) cubic feet of low-level radioactive waste, whichever first occurs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article VI.
     </p>
     <p>
      Other Laws and Regulations
     </p>
     <p>
      a. Nothing in this compact shall be construed to:
     </p>
     <p>
      1. Abrogate or limit the applicability of any act of Congress or diminish or otherwise impair the jurisdiction of any federal agency expressly conferred thereon by the Congress;

     <p>
      2. Abrogate or limit the regulatory responsibility and authority of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission or of an agreement state under Section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 in which a regional facility is located;
     </p>
     <p>
      3. Make inapplicable to any person or circumstance any other law of a party state which is not inconsistent with this compact;
     </p>
     <p>
      4. Make unlawful the continued development and operation of any facility already licensed for development or operation on the date this compact becomes effective, except that any such facility shall comply with Article III, Article IV and Article V and shall be subject to any action lawfully taken pursuant thereto;
     </p>
     <p>
      5. Prohibit any storage or treatment of waste by the generator on its own premises;
     </p>
     <p>
      6. Affect any judicial or administrative proceeding pending on the effective date of this compact;
     </p>
     <p>
      7. Alter the relations between, and the respective internal responsibilities of, the government of a party state and its subdivisions;
     </p>
     <p>
      8. Affect the generation, treatment, storage or disposal of waste generated by the atomic energy defense activities of the Secretary of the United States Department of Energy or federal research and development activities as defined in P.L. 96-573;
     </p>
     <p>
      9. Affect the rights and powers of any party state and its political subdivisions to regulate and license any facility within its borders or to affect the rights and powers of any party state and its political subdivisions to tax or impose fees on the waste managed at any facility within its borders.
     </p>
     <p>
      b. No party state shall pass any law or adopt any regulation which is inconsistent with this compact. To do so may jeopardize the membership status of the party state.
     </p>
     <p>
      c. Upon formation of the compact, no law or regulation of a party state or of any subdivision or instrumentality thereof may be applied so as to restrict or make more inconvenient access to any regional facility by the generators of another party state than for the generators of the state where the facility is situated.
     </p>
     <p>
      d. Restrictions of waste management of regional facilities pursuant to Article IV(l) shall be enforceable as a matter of state law.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article VII.
     </p>
     <p>
      Eligible Parties, Withdrawal, Revocation, Entry into Force, Termination
     </p>
     <p>
      a. This compact shall have as initially eligible parties the States of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia.
     </p>
     <p>
      b. Any state not expressly declared eligible to become a party state to this compact in Section (a) of this article may petition the commission, once constituted, to be declared eligible. The commission may establish such conditions as it deems necessary and appropriate to be met by a state wishing to become eligible to become a party state to this compact pursuant to the provisions of this section. Upon satisfactorily meeting such conditions and upon the affirmative vote of two-thirds (2/3) of the commission, including the affirmative vote of both representatives of a host state in which any affected regional facility is located, the petitioning state shall be eligible to become a party state to this compact and may become a party state in the same manner as those states declared eligible in Section (a) of this article.
     </p>
     <p>
      c. Each state eligible to become a party state to this compact shall be declared a party state upon enactment of this compact into law by the state and upon payment of the fees required by Article IV(h)(1). The commission shall be the judge of the qualifications of the party states and of its members and of their compliance with the conditions and requirements of this compact and the laws of the party states relating to the enactment of this compact.
     </p>
     <p>
      d. 1. The first three (3) states eligible to become party states to this compact which enact this compact into law and appropriate the fees required by Article IV(h)(1) shall immediately, upon the appointment of their commission members, constitute themselves as the Southeast Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management Commission, shall cause legislation to be introduced into the Congress which grants the consent of the Congress to this compact, and shall do those things necessary to organize the commission and implement the provisions of this compact.
     </p>
     <p>
      2. All succeeding states eligible to become party states to this compact shall be declared party states pursuant to the provisions of Section (c) of this article.
     </p>
     <p>
      3. The consent of the Congress shall be required for full implementation of this compact. The provisions of Article V(d) shall not become effective until the effective date of the import ban authorized by Article IV(l) as approved by Congress. The Congress may by law withdraw its consent only every five (5) years.
     </p>
     <p>
      e. No state which holds membership in any other regional compact for the management of low-level radioactive waste may be considered by the compact commission for eligible state status or party state status.
     </p>
     <p>
      f. Any party state which fails to comply with the provisions of this compact or to fulfill the obligations incurred by becoming a party state to this compact may be subject to sanctions by the commission, including suspension of its rights under this compact, and revocation of its status as a party state. Any sanction shall be imposed only upon the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the commission members. Revocation of party state status may take effect on the date of the meeting at which the commission approves the resolution imposing such sanction, but in no event shall revocation take effect later than ninety (90) days from the date of such meeting. Rights and obligations incurred by being declared a party state to this compact shall continue until the effective date of the sanction imposed or as provided in the resolution of the commission imposing the sanction.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission must, as soon as practicable after the meeting at which a resolution revoking status as a party state is approved, provide written notice of the action along with a copy of the resolution to the governors, the presidents of the senates, and the speakers of the houses of representatives of the party states, as well as chairmen of the appropriate committees of the Congress.
     </p>
     <p>
      g. Subject to the provisions of Article VII(h), any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a law repealing the compact, provided that if a regional facility is located within such state, such regional facility shall remain available to the region for four (4) years after the date the commission receives verification in writing from the governor of such party state of the rescission of the compact. The commission, upon receipt of the notification, shall, as soon as practicable, provide copies of such notification to the governors, the presidents of the senates, and the speakers of the houses of representatives of the party states, as well as the chairmen of the appropriate committees of the Congress.
     </p>
     <p>
      h. The right of a party state to withdraw pursuant to Article VII(g) shall terminate thirty (30) days following the commencement of operation of the second host state facility. Thereafter, a party state may withdraw only with the unanimous approval of the commission and with the consent of Congress. For purposes of this section, the low-level radioactive waste disposal facility located in Barnwell County, South Carolina, shall be considered the first host state disposal facility.
     </p>
     <p>
      i. This compact may be terminated only by the affirmative action of the Congress or by the rescission of all laws enacting the compact in each party state.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article VIII.
     </p>
     <p>
      Penalties
     </p>
     <p>
      a. Each party state, consistently with its own law, shall prescribe and enforce penalties against any person not an official of another state for violation of any provision of this compact.
     </p>
     <p>
      b. Each party state acknowledges that the receipt by a host state of waste packaged or transported in violation of applicable laws and regulations can result in imposition of sanctions by the host state which may include suspension or revocation of the violator’s right of access to the facility in the host state.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article IX.
     </p>
     <p>
      Severability and Construction
     </p>
     <p>
      The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If any provision of this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state participating therein, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters. The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed to give effect to the purposes thereof.

The company shall provide a guarantee if, and only if and to the extent that, it determines that such a guarantee is reasonably necessary in order to stimulate or facilitate the making of the eligible export trade transaction, upon terms which will enable the export transaction to be reasonably competitive with export transactions in other states or in foreign countries, or such guarantee is reasonably necessary in order to stimulate or facilitate the sale or resale of such eligible export trade transaction to a holder in due course which would not otherwise purchase such eligible export trade transaction; provided, however, that the guarantee provided by the company to the bank shall be loaned to the business at a fixed interest rate and term as the company may from time to time require. The interest rate and term of such loan shall not be in violation of the 1947 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The company may condition the provision of guarantee hereunder upon such terms and conditions as it may deem desirable to carry out the provisions of this chapter.

    Guidelines, rules, and regulations for repayment of funds.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The Mississippi Development Authority shall establish such guidelines, rules and regulations for the repayment of funds loaned pursuant to this chapter as may be necessary. These provisions shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
     </p>
     <p>
      Funds may be loaned for a maximum of ten (10) years or the estimated useful life of the property as established by the United States Department of Treasury, whichever is greater.
     </p>
     <p>
      The rate of interest charged by the Mississippi Development Authority for improvements not on publicly owned property may be negotiated by the Mississippi Development Authority.
     </p>
     <p>
      For all improvements funded through this chapter which occur on publicly owned property, repayment of funds loaned may, in the discretion of the Mississippi Development Authority, involve only the principal amount loaned with no interest charged thereon.
     </p>
     <p>
      An audit by a certified public accountant of all costs of a project hereunder must be submitted to the Mississippi Development Authority not later than ninety (90) days after a project’s completion. Such an audit shall certify that all of the funds loaned or granted pursuant to this chapter were disbursed in accordance with the terms of this chapter and shall be paid for by the private company benefited by the project. In addition to the audit required under this paragraph, the State Auditor may conduct performance and compliance audits under this chapter according to Section 7-7-211(o) and may bill the oversight agency.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an application under Section 57-61-9(5) (a), the guidelines shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
     </p>
     <p>
      Funds may be loaned for a maximum of twenty (20) years, or the estimated useful life of improvements on the land areas of the port, whichever is greater.
     </p>
     <p>
      The rate of interest charged by the Mississippi Development Authority for loans for port projects may be negotiated by the Mississippi Development Authority and shall be consistent with Section 57-61-11(b) and (c).
     </p>
     <p>
      The total of grants and loans to any one (1) state-owned port made pursuant to an application under Section 57-61-9(5)(a) shall not exceed Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000.00).
     </p>
     <p>
      Before any loan or grant may be made under Section 57-61-9(5)(a) to a state-owned port bordering the Gulf of Mexico, the applicant shall make adequate assurance to the Mississippi Development Authority that federal participation in the cost of the project or projects has been committed contingent only upon availability of local participation in accordance with federal guidelines.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary, the Mississippi Development Authority shall utilize not more than Four Million Dollars ($4,000,000.00) out of the proceeds of bonds authorized to be issued in this chapter to be made available as interest-bearing loans to state-owned ports for the purpose of repairing, renovating, maintaining and improving the state-owned port. The Mississippi Development Authority shall establish an amortization schedule for the repayment of any loans made pursuant to this subparagraph. The state-owned port shall not spend any revenues for other purposes unless payments on the loan are being timely made according to the amortization schedule. The match requirements of this section and Section 57-61-9 shall not apply to any loan made pursuant to this subparagraph.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary, the Mississippi Development Authority shall utilize not more than Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000.00) out of the proceeds of bonds authorized to be issued in this chapter for the purpose of making loans to municipalities operating county-owned ports or municipally owned ports for the purpose of acquiring land, buildings and other improvements and for repairing, renovating, maintaining and improving such ports. The Mississippi Development Authority shall establish an amortization schedule for the repayment of any loans made pursuant to this paragraph (f). A municipality shall not spend any port revenues for other purposes unless payments on the loan are being timely made according to the amortization schedule.

    Powers and duties of public agencies and political subdivisions.

     </h3>
     <p>
      For the purpose of aiding in the planning, design, undertaking and carrying out of the project or any facility related to the project, or any educational, cultural, housing or recreational facility or enhancement offered to secure the siting of the project in the state, any public agency or political subdivision of any kind is authorized and empowered upon such terms, with or without consideration, as it may determine: (a) to enter into agreements, which may extend over any period, with the authority respecting action to be taken by such public agency or political subdivision with respect to the acquisition, planning, construction, improvement, operation, maintenance or funding of the project or any such facility or enhancement, including without limitation (i) the appropriation or payment of funds to the authority or to a trustee in amounts which shall be sufficient to enable the authority to defray any designated portion or percentage of the expenses of administering, planning, designing, constructing, acquiring, improving, operating, and maintaining the project or any such facility or enhancement, (ii) the appropriation or payment of funds to the authority or to a trustee to pay interest and principal (whether at maturity or upon sinking fund redemption) on bonds of the authority issued pursuant to this chapter and to fund reserves for debt service, for operation and maintenance and for renewals and replacements, and to fulfill requirements of any covenant with respect to debt service contained in any resolution, trust indenture or other security agreement relating to the bonds of the authority issued pursuant to this chapter and (iii) the furnishing of other assistance in connection with the project or any such facility or enhancement; (b) to dedicate, sell, donate, convey or lease any property or interest in property to the authority or grant easements, licenses or other rights or privileges therein to the authority; (c) to incur the entire expense of any public improvements made or to be made by such public agency or political subdivision in exercising the powers granted in this section; (d) to do any and all things necessary to aid or cooperate in the planning or carrying out of the project or any such facility or enhancement; (e) to lend, grant or contribute funds to the authority; (f) to cause public buildings and public facilities, including parks, playgrounds, recreational areas, community meeting facilities, water, sewer or drainage facilities, or any other works which it is otherwise empowered to undertake, to be furnished to or with respect to the project or any such facility or enhancement; (g) to furnish, dedicate, close, vacate, pave, install, upgrade or improve highways, streets, roads, sidewalks, airports, railroads, ports or other public facilities; (h) to plan or replan, zone or rezone any parcel of land within the public agency or political subdivision or make exceptions from land use, building and zoning regulations; and (i) to cause administrative and other services to be furnished to the authority, including services pertaining to the acquisition of real property and the furnishing of relocation assistance. Any contract between a public agency or political subdivision entered into with the authority pursuant to any of the powers granted by this chapter shall be binding upon said public agency or political subdivision according to its terms, and such public agency or political subdivision shall have the power to enter into such contracts as in the discretion of the governing authorities thereof would be to the best interest of the people of such public agency or political subdivision. Such contracts may include within the discretion of such governing authorities a pledge of the full faith and credit of such political subdivision for the performance thereof. If such contracts include a pledge of the full faith and credit of such political subdivision, then for the purposes of Sections 27-39-321 and 37-57-107, the indebtedness created by such contracts shall be deemed to be general obligation bonds. The obligations of any public agency or political subdivision arising under the terms of such contracts shall not be included within the indebtedness of such public agency or political subdivision for the purposes of any constitutional or statutory limitation or provision. If at any time title to or possession of the project or any such facility or enhancement is held by any public body or governmental agency other than the authority, including any agency or instrumentality of the United States of America, the agreements referred to in this section shall inure to the benefit of and may be enforced by such public body or governmental agency.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding any provisions of this chapter to the contrary, any contract entered into between the authority and any political subdivision for the appropriation or payment of funds to the authority under item (a)(ii) of this section shall contain a provision therein requiring monthly payments by the political subdivision to pay its indebtedness and, if the political subdivision is not a county or municipality, such contract shall include as an additional party to the contract the county or municipality (referred to in this paragraph as “levying authority”) that levies and collects taxes for the contracting political subdivision. If the political subdivision fails to pay its indebtedness for any month, the authority shall certify to the State Tax Commission, or other appropriate agency, the amount of the delinquency, and the State Tax Commission shall deduct such amount from the political subdivision’s or levying authority’s, as the case may be, next allocation of sales taxes, petroleum taxes, highway privilege taxes, severance taxes, Tennessee Valley Authority payments in lieu of taxes and homestead exemption reimbursements in that order of priority. The State Tax Commission, or other appropriate agency, shall pay the sums so deducted to the authority to be applied to the discharge of the contractual obligation.

    Power of authority to issue refunding bonds.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The authority may issue refunding bonds for the purpose of paying any of its bonds at or prior to maturity or upon acceleration or redemption. Refunding bonds may be issued at such time prior to the maturity or redemption of the refunded bonds as the authority deems to be in the public interest, without notice and without an election on the question of the issuance thereof. The refunding bonds may be issued in sufficient amounts to pay or provide the principal of the bonds being refunded, together with any redemption premium thereon, any interest accrued or to accrue to the date of payment of such bonds, the expenses of issue of the refunding bonds, the expenses of redeeming the bonds being refunded, and such reserves for debt service or other capital or current expenses from the proceeds of such refunding bonds as may be required by the resolution, trust indenture or other security instruments. The issue of refunding bonds, the maturities and other details thereof, the security therefor, the rights of the holders and the rights, duties and obligations of the authority in respect of the same shall be governed by the provisions of this chapter relating to the issue of bonds other than refunding bonds insofar as the same may be applicable. Any such refunding may be effected, whether the obligations to be refunded shall have then matured or shall thereafter mature, either by the exchange of the refunding bonds for the obligations to be refunded thereby with the consent of the holders of the obligations so to be refunded, or by sale of the refunding bonds and the application of the proceeds thereof to the payment of the obligations proposed to be refunded thereby, and regardless of whether the obligations proposed to be refunded shall be payable on the same date or different dates or shall be due serially or otherwise.

The authority may also provide in such resolution, trust indenture or other security instrument that the trustee, or in the event that the trustee so appointed shall fail or decline to so protect and enforce such registered owners’ rights then such percentage of registered owners as shall be set forth in, and subject to the provisions of, such resolution, trust indenture or other security interest, may petition the court of proper jurisdiction for the appointment of a receiver of the revenues which are pledged to the payment of the principal of and interest on the bonds of such registered owners.

   Corporation did not qualify for jobs tax credit because it was clear that Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t57c73s57-73-21ol14" target="_self">57-73-21(4)</a></cite> mandated that the number of new full-time employees was to be calculated by comparing the number of employees in the year for which the tax credit was taken with the number of employees from the previous year; following this logic, it was apparent that a business had to have an increase of 20 employees in order to merit the jobs tax credit, and this number was determined by comparing the increase in employees with the number of employees from the previous year.

       § 57-73-23.
    Income tax credit for employer providing dependent care for employees.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A fifty percent (50%) income tax credit shall be granted to any employer providing dependent care for employees during the employee’s work hours. Credit is applied to the net cost of any contract executed by the employer for another entity to provide dependent care; or, if the employer elects to provide dependent care itself, to expenses of dependent care staff, learning and recreational materials and equipment, and the construction and maintenance of a facility. Additional eligible expenses include net costs assumed by the employer which increase the quality, availability and affordability of dependent care in the community used by employees during the employee’s work hours. This cost is net of any reimbursement. A deduction shall not be allowed for any expenses which serve as the basis for an income tax credit. The credits allowed under this section shall not be used by any business enterprise or corporation other than the business enterprise actually qualifying for the credits.
     </p>
     <p>
      Credit may be carried forward for the five (5) successive years if the amount allowable as credit exceeds income tax liability in a tax year; however, thereafter, if the amount allowable as a credit exceeds the tax liability, the amount of excess shall not be refundable or carried forward to any other taxable year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The facility must have an average daily enrollment for the taxable year of no less than six (6) children who are twelve (12) years of age or less and be licensed according to the regulations governing licensure of child care facilities in Mississippi; or must serve five (5) or fewer children and/or elderly adults in a family child care/elder care home approved by the Department of Health for participation in the United States Department of Agriculture child and adult nutrition program; or must serve children over twelve (12) years of age but less than eighteen (18) years of age in either a community-based facility or a facility at the employment site; or must serve adult relatives of employees in either a community-based elder care facility or a facility at the employment site; or must serve children or adult dependents having physical, emotional or mental disabilities in either a community-based facility or a facility at the employment site.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employers will be certified as eligible for the tax credit by the Mississippi Department of Health for programs serving children twelve (12) years of age or younger and for programs serving elderly adults and by the State Tax Commission for programs serving other dependents older than twelve (12) years of age.

    Legislative intent.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The Legislature finds that the Venture Capital Act of 1994, Sections 57-77-1 through 57-77-39, Mississippi Code of 1972, has not been implemented in accordance with the legislative intent. The Legislature finds that the Venture Capital Act of 1994 needs to be amended for the purpose of clarifying the legislative intent and for the further purpose of ensuring public trust in the venture capital loan program by providing safeguards in the operation of the program and over the proper administration of the use of public funds. The Legislature finds that persons are purporting to serve on the Magnolia Capital Corporation Board of Directors and the Magnolia Venture Capital Corporation Board of Directors in violation of the legislative intent of the Venture Capital Act of 1994. Pursuant to Section 178 of the Mississippi Constitution of 1890, the Legislature finds that it is in the public interest to amend the charters of incorporation of the Magnolia Capital Corporation and the Magnolia Venture Capital Corporation which were authorized to be formed under the provisions of the Venture Capital Act of 1994, and the amendments made to Sections 57-77-9 and 57-77-11 by Chapter 563, Laws of 1998, shall be amendments to the charters of incorporation of the Magnolia Capital Corporation and the Magnolia Venture Capital Corporation.

Funds loaned by the department pursuant to Section 57-77-17, and all earnings on such funds shall remain, and shall be considered to be, public funds. Except as provided in Section 57-77-33(7), it is, and has always been, the intent of the Legislature that nothing in this chapter shall be construed to waive the sovereign immunity of the State of Mississippi or the department pursuant to either state law or the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution.

       Pursuant to Section 1-1-109, the Joint Legislative Committee on Compilation, Revision and Publication of Legislation corrected
   typographical errors in subsections (4) and (8). A comma was inserted after “permanent bonds” in subsection (4), so that “. . . may . . . issue in lieu of permanent bonds temporary bonds in such form” was changed to “. . . may . . . issue in lieu of permanent bonds, temporary bonds in such form.” In subsection (8), the words “enter into contracts with financial institutions . . . to chapter as registrar” were changed to “enter into contracts with financial institutions . . . to act as registrar.” The Joint Committee ratified the correction at its April 26, 2001 meeting.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The Legislature finds and determines that there exists in this state a continuing need for programs to assist certain counties in encouraging economic development, the consequent job creation and retention, additional private investment and increased local and state revenue which together insures the further development of a balanced economy. To achieve these purposes, it is necessary to assist and encourage the creation of growth and prosperity by providing temporary relief from certain taxes within certain counties and within specific supervisors districts in certain other counties to certain business enterprises.
     </p>
     <p>
      Further, the Legislature finds and determines that the authority granted under this chapter and the purposes to be accomplished hereby are proper governmental and public purposes and that the resulting economic benefits to the state are of paramount importance, mandating that the provisions of this chapter be liberally construed and applied in order to advance the public purposes.

      The Legislature finds and determines that:
     </p>
     <p>
      There exists in the State of Mississippi a continuing need for gainful employment for the citizens of the rural areas of the state.
     </p>
     <p>
      To help provide employment opportunities and to impact the quality of life in these rural areas, a division within the Mississippi Development Authority should be created with power to promote business and economic development through job producing programs and by providing financial assistance to communities and businesses.
     </p>
     <p>
      In accomplishing this purpose, such division will be acting in all respects for the benefit of the people of the state in the performance of essential public functions and serving a valid purpose in improving or otherwise promoting their health, welfare and prosperity, and the enactment of the provisions hereinafter set forth is for a valid public purpose.
     </p>
     <p>
      The borrowing of money and the issuance of bonds for the purposes hereinafter set forth serves valid public purposes that will contribute to the employment base of the state.

      <li id="t57c87s57-87-3ol11">
       The Legislature finds that the long-standing telecommunications policy of this state has been to ensure that all citizens have access to telephone service. The increasing reliance upon access to computer information services for jobs, housing and other necessities requires that this concept be broadened to include high-speed access to the Internet as well.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c87s57-87-3ol12">
       The Legislature further finds that the ability of the citizens in all parts of this state to access the Internet, also known as the information superhighway, is an important component in the ability of the state to remain competitive in the fields of business and education, as well as the ability of government to provide services to these people both now and in the future. The ability of the citizens of Mississippi to access the full potential of the Internet is predicated on having the most advanced telecommunications infrastructure - the backbone to the information superhighway.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c87s57-87-3ol13">
       The Legislature further finds and declares that it is the policy of the state to provide incentives for “telecommunications enterprises” (as defined in Section 57-73-21(14)) to invest in the infrastructure needed to provide broadband technology throughout the state to keep this state competitive and to promote economic development within the state.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c87s57-87-3ol14">
       The Legislature further finds that despite the significant growth of computer ownership and usage, the growth has occurred to a greater extent within developed areas within this state, thereby leading to what has been termed a “digital divide” between Tier One areas within the state and areas within this state that are Tier Two and Tier Three areas (as such areas are designated in accordance with Section 57-73-21(1)).
      </li>
      <li id="t57c87s57-87-3ol15">
       The Legislature further finds that it is in the public interest for people living in Tier Two areas and people living in Tier Three areas of the state to have high-speed access to the Internet and to adequate technology, infrastructure and advanced telecommunications service.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c87s57-87-3ol16">
       The Legislature further finds and declares that additional incentives are warranted to encourage telecommunications enterprises to invest in the infrastructure needed to provide broadband technology in Tier Two and Tier Three areas of the state.

    Legislative findings; provisions of chapter to be liberally construed.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The Legislature finds and determines that there exists in this state a continuing need for programs to assist certain counties and municipalities in encouraging economic development, the consequent job creation and retention, additional private investment and increased local and state revenue which together insures the further development of a balanced economy. The Legislature further finds that this need is particularly great in counties and municipalities where there are located certain environmentally contaminated sites that are not currently conducive to such economic development. To achieve the combined purposes of encouraging economic development on and around environmentally contaminated sites, it is necessary to assist and encourage such economic development by providing temporary tax incentives within certain counties and municipalities to certain business enterprises.
     </p>
     <p>
      Further, the Legislature finds and determines that the authority granted under this chapter and the purposes to be accomplished hereby are proper governmental and public purposes and that the resulting economic benefits to the state are of paramount importance, mandating that the provisions of this chapter be liberally construed and applied in order to advance the public purposes.

If the Seed Fund Investment Board approves the application, the MTA shall negotiate a contract with the business regarding any assistance provided to the business under the program, the expenditure of assistance provided to the business, repayment of assistance by the business, and any other matters to which the parties may agree. Any such contract must provide for at least the following: (i) that any assistance provided to the business will be on a reimbursement basis in which the business will expend funds according to the terms of the contract and submit invoices, receipts and other applicable documentation and information to the MTA for reimbursement; (ii) that no funds may be expended or used for patent prosecution, reorganization of the business, or payment of any existing debt of the business outstanding or otherwise incurred at the time the contract is entered into; (iii) that no funds may be expended to reimburse expenses for work conducted or services provided by the business, a university or a third party consultant if those expenses were incurred before the term of the contract; (iv) that at least fifty-one percent (51%) of the funds received by the business must be expended with a Mississippi university, college and/or community/junior college with which the business has a contract for research and development or technology development work or services; (v) that the MTA will pay not more than ten percent (10%) of overhead expenses for the business and/or the university, college and/or community/junior college; (vi) that the business will provide matching funding of One Dollar ($1.00) for every One Dollar ($1.00) of assistance, with at least fifty percent (50%) of the match being in cash and the remaining amount being from in-kind services, all of which must be documented by time sheets, payroll receipts, invoices and other documentation or information required by the MTA; and (vii) that the business receiving assistance will retain ownership of any technology developed by the business before the start of the project for which assistance is received, and that rights to new intellectual property developed as a result of the project will be subject to mutually agreed upon terms and conditions of the collaborative research agreement executed by the business and the university, college and/or community/junior college before the start of the project. Assistance received by a business and not expended for purposes required in the contract between the business and the MTA may be expended for hiring third party consultants to assist the business, working capital, marketing, prototype development and equipment. The amount of assistance that a business may receive under the program shall not exceed One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00) in any one (1) year and shall not exceed Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000.00) in the aggregate.

       There is established under the direction of the Mississippi Technology Alliance (“MTA”) a program to be known as the “Rural Innovation Program-Level 2” for the purpose of making assistance available to provide working capital to support the continued capitalization of technology based businesses in rural Mississippi.

         In order to be eligible for assistance under the program, a business must: (i) have its principal place of business based in a rural county in Mississippi, (ii) produce or provide a product and/or service that is science or technology related, (iii) have fewer than one hundred fifty (150) employees, and (iv) have completed its product and/or service development planning. For the purposes of this paragraph, a “rural county” shall be a county designated as such by the MTA.

         Any business desiring to participate in the program must submit an application to the MTA. The application must contain a description of the purposes for which the assistance is requested, the amount of assistance requested and any other information requested by the MTA. If the MTA staff reviewing the application determines that an application should be reviewed by the Seed Fund Investment Board appointed by the MTA Board of Directors, the application shall be forwarded to the Seed Fund Investment Board. If the Seed Fund Investment Board approves the application, the MTA shall negotiate a contract with the business regarding any assistance provided to the business under the program, the expenditure of the assistance provided to the business, and any other matters to which the parties may agree. Any such contract must provide for at least the following: (i) that any assistance provided to the business will be on a reimbursement basis in which the business will expend funds according to the terms of the contract and submit invoices, receipts and other applicable documentation and information to the MTA for reimbursement; (ii) that no funds may be expended or used for patent prosecution, reorganization of the business, or payment of any existing debt of the business outstanding or otherwise incurred at the time the contract is entered into; (iii) that no funds may be expended to reimburse expenses for work conducted or services provided by the business, a university or a third party consultant if those expenses were incurred before the term of the contract; (iv) that the business receiving assistance will retain ownership of any technology developed by the business regardless of whether the technology is developed before or after the receipt of assistance; and (v) that the business will provide matching funding of One Dollar ($1.00) for every One Dollar ($1.00) of assistance, with at least fifty percent (50%) of the match being from an accredited investor or strategic investment partner, as determined by the MTA, and the remaining amount being from in-kind services, all of which must be documented by time sheets, payroll receipts, invoices and other documentation or information required by the MTA. Assistance received by a business may be expended for hiring third party consultants to assist the business and for equipment. The amount of assistance that a business may receive under the program shall not exceed One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00) in any one (1) year and shall not exceed Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000.00) in the aggregate.

         Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, a business receiving assistance under the program shall be required to repay the assistance in the manner provided in this paragraph. Repayment shall be made through the use of a convertible note in which the business will repay one hundred percent (100%) of the amount of assistance received if such repayment is made within thirty-six (36) months from the date the assistance is received, with the amount to be repaid by the business increasing at a rate determined by the parties in the contract up to an amount not to exceed two hundred percent (200%) of the amount of assistance if such repayment is made later than thirty-six (36) months from the date the assistance is received but not later than sixty (60) months from the date the assistance is received. The MTA shall have the option of converting the amount of assistance awarded to the business into common stock of the business or into a royalty in the gross sales of the business. Amounts received as repayments shall be deposited into the special fund created in subsection (3) of this section. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this paragraph, if the business receiving assistance fails to meet certain financial performance levels established in the contract between the business and the MTA and the contract does not activate any repayment provisions, then the MTA will deem the assistance provided to be a loss and the business receiving assistance shall not be required to repay the assistance received.
