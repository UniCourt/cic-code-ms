   Navigable waters are those waters which are navigable in fact; those waters are navigable in fact which are navigable by loggers, fishermen and pleasure boaters. Ryals v. Pigott, 580 So. 2d 1140, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 694 (Miss. 1990), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">502 U.S. 940</cite>, <cite class="s_court">112 S. Ct. 377</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">116 L.

       In an action to quiet title and to enjoin trespass, wherein the defendants claimed a right to enter upon a stream located upon the land, where it was shown that the stream was only nine miles long, was obstructed at many points, and had never been used as a water highway for commercial or other traffic except that at the turn of the century logs had sometimes been floated down it, it was apparent that the stream was not a navigable waterway which the defendants as members of the general public were entitled to enter upon at will. Downes v. Crosby Chemicals, Inc., 234 So. 2d 916, 1970 Miss. LEXIS 1428 (Miss. 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute defining navigable waters is not unconstitutionally vague or incapable of exact definition or application, and it is apparent that the statute was intended to exclude small private creeks and streams, not navigable in fact, and declare navigable only streams actually capable of being navigated by substantial commercial traffic. Downes v. Crosby Chemicals, Inc., 234 So. 2d 916, 1970 Miss. LEXIS 1428 (Miss. 1970).

      <p>
       Applicable case law and statutory law would allow someone utilizing public waters to tie to tree or drop anchor since this is normal use by those engaged in fishing or other water sports; waterfowl hunter has right to utilize water surface on any public waterway and this would include right to float freely on and anchor to beds of waterway in order to carry out this sport; wading by hunter along bed of public waterway is also allowed. 1993 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 836.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enforcement officers of the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks should regard the location of the “ordinary and natural banks” of public waterways as a factual determination which must be made on a case by case basis when enforcing criminal and game laws, and prosecutors should be prepared to show proof of the locations of banks to the court hearing the matter. 2007 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 134, 2007 Miss. AG LEXIS 92.

       Circuit court improperly ruled for a family in their action against the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks (MDWFP) because it erroneously applied the legal standard for reckless disregard under the Mississippi Torts Claim Act; the river constituted a public Mississippi waterway, and the MDWFP possessed both the authority to regulate the boating traffic on the river and the discretion to do so in a safe manner. Miss. Dep't of Wildlife, Fisheries, & Parks v. Webb, 248 So.3d 823, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 217 (Miss. Ct. App. 2017), rev'd, 248 So.3d 772, 2018 Miss. LEXIS 127 (Miss. 2018).

   A river was navigable in fact, and therefore constituted public waters, where the customary mode of travel on the river was through small outboard motorboats, fishing boats, canoes, tubes and other pleasure craft, the customary mode of commerce and trade was providing facilities for hire where persons could rent such vessels, and the river was capable in its ordinary condition of supporting commercial fishing. Ryals v. Pigott, 580 So. 2d 1140, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 694 (Miss. 1990), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">502 U.S. 940</cite>, <cite class="s_court">112 S. Ct. 377</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">116 L.

   A river was a public waterway, so that riparian landowners could acquire no rights in the surface or waters other than those they enjoyed as members of the general public, where the river was navigable in fact or with reasonable channel maintenance and dredging, and the river had a mean annual flow of 188 cubic feet per second and had been designated a public waterway by the Mississippi Department of Natural Resources [now Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality], thus conforming to the standards of the 1988 amendment to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t51c01s51-1-4" target="_self">51-1-4</a></cite>.

   Section<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t51c01s51-1-4" target="_self">51-1-4</a></cite>’s 100 cubic feet per second standard for determining what constitutes a public waterway suffers no constitutional or other infirmity when scrutinized under §§ 14, 17 or 81 of the Mississippi Constitution or otherwise, or under federal law, including but not limited to the Equal Footings Doctrine and the congressional enactment of 1817 creating the State of Mississippi.

   Reasonable interpretation of “unless” language of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t51c01s51-1-4" target="_self">51-1-4</a></cite> is as savings clause, excluding from operation of statute any causes of action which accrued prior to its effective date (April 20, 1972).

       <p>
   Obvious legislative intent behind §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t51c01s51-1-4" target="_self">51-1-4</a></cite> was to encourage free public use of waterways of state for recreation by eliminating conflicting interests of riparian landowners at least insofar as actual streams of waterways are concerned.

   Nothing in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t51c01s51-1-4" target="_self">51-1-4</a></cite> relieves landowner of liability for maintaining dangerous condition on his land; thus, as to negligence occurring outside waterway stream (i.e., maintenance of land from which plaintiff dived into river and failure to post adequate warnings thereon), which may have caused or contributed to plaintiff’s injury, statute offers no absolute bar to recovery.

       The waters and the soil under the waters of the bay of St. Louis over which the state highway commission erected a bridge, are public highways which are owned by the state in trust for the people of the state and those rights constituting that title cannot be sold or transferred irrevocably.

      <p>
       Where state constructed a bridge across the bay of St. Louis, which bridge was partly across area of riparian owners who had been granted the privilege and license of planting and gathering oysters and erecting bathhouses and other structures, the state by building this bridge exercised its power to impose an additional public use upon a property which was already set aside for public purposes and the exercise of this power was not taking of property for which compensation must be made.

       § 51-3-1.
    Declaration of policy on conservation of water resources.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      It is hereby declared that the general welfare of the people of the State of Mississippi requires that the water resources of the state be put to beneficial use to the fullest extent of which they are capable, that the waste or unreasonable use, or unreasonable method of use, of water be prevented, that the conservation of such water be exercised with the view to the reasonable and beneficial use thereof in the interest of the people, and that the public and private funds for the promotion and expansion of the beneficial use of water resources shall be invested to the end that the best interests and welfare of the people are served.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is the policy of the Legislature that conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water shall be encouraged for the reasonable and beneficial use of all water resources of the state. The policies, regulations and public laws of the State of Mississippi shall be interpreted and administered so that, to the fullest extent possible, the ground and surface water resources within the state shall be integrated in their use, storage, allocation and management.
     </p>
     <p>
      All water, whether occurring on the surface of the ground or underneath the surface of the ground, is hereby declared to be among the basic resources of this state to therefore belong to the people of this state and is subject to regulation in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. The control and development and use of water for all beneficial purposes shall be in the state, which, in the exercise of its police powers, shall take such measures to effectively and efficiently manage, protect and utilize the water resources of Mississippi.

       Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality Permit Board did not err in granting groundwater withdrawal permits to a county utility authority because the factors it considered were reasonable, it made specific findings as to each factor, and its findings were supported by substantial evidence; the utility authority owned the land upon which it would install wells for the groundwater withdrawal and planned to use the water for public water supply, the highest-ranked beneficial use of water.

       Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter, a person using water for only domestic purposes shall not be required to obtain a permit to use water for domestic purposes, and no permit shall be required for the use of surface water in impoundments that are not located on continuous, free-flowing watercourses. No permit shall be required for any use of water obtained from a well with a surface casing diameter of less than six (6) inches; however, a permit shall be required of a person in the business of developing real property for resale who desires to withdraw water from a well, regardless of surface casing diameter, that is to be used for maintaining or enhancing an impoundment of surface water primarily for aesthetic purposes. If the commission declares and delineates a water use caution area as provided in Section 51-3-11, the permit board may require permits for withdrawals of water in excess of twenty thousand (20,000) gallons per day, including withdrawals of water for uses exempted under this subsection.

The board may authorize a permittee to use the established minimum flow for industrial purposes when the water shall be returned to the stream at a point downstream from the place of withdrawal, where the board finds that the use will not result in any substantial detriment to property owners affected thereby or to the public interest.

       § 51-4-5.
    Public policy declared.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The Legislature finds that certain selected streams and stream segments of this state possess unique or outstanding scenic, recreational, geological, botanical, fish, wildlife, historic or cultural values. It is the policy of the Legislature to provide for the protection of these streams and to conserve the state’s natural heritage for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations, while preserving the private property rights of riparian landowners.
     </p>
     <p>
      There is a necessity for a rational balance between the use of these streams and the conservation of the natural beauty along these streams. The Legislature finds that this balance will best be achieved through a nonregulatory voluntary stewardship program emphasizing local education, participation and support. The primary goal of the program is to maximize voluntary private conservation efforts and to build and maintain a sense of stewardship among stream users and riparian landowners. To accomplish this goal, the program must provide a nonregulatory framework to obtain cooperative, voluntary management agreements with riparian landowners to maintain scenic values while ensuring the rights of riparian landowners to continue customary uses along the stream.

       Every person, firm and corporation desiring to engage in the business of drilling and developing wells for underground water, including drilling any wells or boreholes that may penetrate water-bearing formations, in the State of Mississippi, shall file an application with the Mississippi Commission on Environmental Quality (commission) for a water well contractor’s license, using forms prepared by the commission, setting out qualifications therefor and providing such other information, including test scores from any examination, oral or written, as may be required by the commission. Developing wells shall include the installation and servicing of pumps and well equipment, but shall not include the installation and servicing of above-ground pumps. The fee for such license and renewal thereof shall be One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) for each year.

       All licenses shall expire on June 30 of each year. Licenses shall not be transferable or assignable. A license may be renewed and shall be renewable without examination for the ensuing year by making an application not later than the expiration date, providing certification that the required continuing education units have been completed, and paying the applicable fee. Such application shall have the effect of extending the validity of the current license until the new license is issued or until the applicant is notified by the commission that the request for renewal has been denied. If an application has not been received by the commission by the expiration date, the license will expire and the licensee will be prohibited from performing any work for which the license is required until such time as the license has been reinstated. On application made after June 30 of each year, the license may be reinstated only upon compliance with all requirements for renewal, including payment of the applicable fee, plus a penalty of Ten Dollars ($10.00) for each month or fraction thereof the application is delinquent. Failure to request reinstatement within one (1) year after a license has expired may, in the discretion of the commission, be deemed a waiver of the licensee’s right to reinstatement without examination; and if he should request reinstatement thereafter, the commission may require that he be considered a new applicant subject to all requirements for initial licensing including the requirement for examination.

     </h3>
     <p>
      If the chancery court determines that any objections filed are not sufficient to defeat the organization of the district, and if it be determined by the chancery court to proceed with the organization of the proposed district, the chancery court shall enter an order appointing at least five commissioners who, as the board of commissioners of said master water management district, shall be its governing body. Each of said commissioners shall be a qualified elector of this state and a landowner in the territory proposed to be included in said district, and there shall be at least one such commissioner who is a landowner within each drainage district or water management district having territory in such master water management district and at least one who is a landowner within the territory to be included in such master water management district which is not within an existing drainage or water management district.
     </p>
     <p>
      The term of office of commissioners of a master water management district shall be four years, except that in making the first appointments the chancery court shall appoint at least three commissioners for terms of one, two, and three years respectively, in order that the terms of all commissioners shall not expire at once; and each commissioner shall serve for the term for which he is appointed and until his successor has been appointed and has qualified. Subsequent appointments and appointments to fill vacancies in office shall be made by the chancery court in the court district of original jurisdiction in the creation of the master water management district. If a majority of the landowners in any such district or proposed district by number petition the court for the appointment of any particular qualified person, such person shall be appointed by the court, provided the requirements of the first paragraph of this section are fulfilled.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commissioners shall take the oath of office required by section 268 of article 14 of the constitution of the state and shall give bond in the penalty of not less than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) payable to the state for the use and benefit of the master water management district, such bond to be filed with and approved by the chancery clerk of the county in which the petition was filed. The commissioners shall immediately organize and select one of their number as president and another of their number as secretary for a term not to exceed four years. Commissioners shall receive compensation for their services at the rate of twelve dollars and fifty cents ($12.50) per diem provided for commissioners of drainage districts for time spent on the work of the board, in addition to their actual expenses, including traveling expenses, necessarily incurred in the discharge of their duties.

    Development of plans.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      After appointment and organization proceedings as hereinbefore provided, the commissioners shall develop in conjunction with the United States Secretary of Agriculture, or with the head of such other federal agency as may be involved, plans for works of improvement within the scope of Section 51-7-1, which are to be carried out within or without the area of said master water management district. Whatever federal financial or other assistance is furnished in connection with the planning or construction of the proposed improvements, such plans and specifications shall be detailed only to the extent required by the federal department or agency responsible for furnishing such assistance. In connection with the development of such plans, the said commissioners, with approval of the chancery court, may incur expenses for engineering work, legal services, costs of publication and other administrative expenses, and other necessary preliminary expenses, including acquisition of easements and rights-of-way. For the payment of any such expenses the district may, with the approval of the chancery court, borrow money at a rate of interest not exceeding that allowed in Section 75-17-105, and issue negotiable notes or other evidences of indebtedness therefor, signed by the president and secretary of said board of commissioners, said notes or other evidences of indebtedness to be payable to the lender, or bearer, as said commissioners may elect. None of the said evidence of indebtedness so issued shall run for more than two (2) years, but they shall be subject to renewal for one (1) additional period up to two (2) years, and they shall be nontaxable. The commissioners may pledge all assessments on the land within the district made under provisions of this chapter for the payment of said evidences of indebtedness. Said obligations may be paid out of any general or special fund of the district, if organized, or out of the proceeds of the first assessments levied under this chapter. In the event said district is not organized after said indebtedness has been incurred, then the board of supervisors of the respective county or counties having territory or territories in such proposed district shall, on order of the chancery court, levy an acreage or an ad valorem tax against the lands embraced in said proposed district. If an ad valorem tax be levied, the board of supervisors may use for that purpose the assessments of the land according to the last assessment roll of the county in which said lands are situated; and in case the lands in the proposed district lie in more than one (1) county, then the chancery court shall apportion said indebtedness between the several counties, and the board of supervisors shall thereupon levy such apportioned tax upon the lands of their counties respectively, according to the ruling of the chancery court.

      As soon as said plans have been developed as hereinbefore provided, a report thereof shall be made by the commissioners, who shall file the same with the clerk of the chancery court. Such report shall include the approval thereof by the board of any levee district within which any master water management district shall be located in whole or in part. Such report shall contain an estimate of the local share of the cost of carrying out the works of improvement, together with an estimate of the total benefits that will accrue to the land in the proposed district. Upon the filing of said report and after fixing a time, date, and place of hearing by the chancellor, the clerk of the chancery court shall thereupon give notice by publication that a hearing will be held on said report and designating a date not less than twenty days and not more than thirty days after the last publication of notice on which such hearing will be held. Said notice shall be published in a newspaper in each county wherein a part of such district is situated, such newspaper to have a general circulation in the area in said county wherein such portion of such district may be located; and said notice shall be published for three weeks in such newspaper. If there be no newspaper published in such county, then the notice provided herein shall be posted for not less than fifteen days, with one copy being posted on the bulletin board at the county courthouse and two copies posted at public places in the area proposed to be included in the master water management district. The notice shall call upon landowners in the district to show cause, if any, against approval of the report by the chancery court.

      At the time named in said notice, or on a subsequent date to which the cause may be continued, the chancellor shall hear all property owners within the district who wish to appear and advocate or resist the carrying out of the work plans as filed within said district, and if he deems it to the best interest of the owners of the real property within said district that said plans be adopted, or adopted as modified by the chancellor, under the provisions of this chapter, he shall make an order approving said report as submitted or as modified. Thereupon the organization of said master water management district shall be deemed to be fully completed, and henceforth the district shall be a governmental subdivision of the state and a public body, corporate and politic, with authority to do and perform in the name of such district all such acts and things for the accomplishment of the purposes for which it was organized. However, if the chancellor shall disapprove said report and shall decline to allow its modification or resubmission, then such district shall not be organized and the terms of office of the commissioners shall terminate, except as to powers which may be necessary in effecting payment of any preliminary indebtedness as provided in Section 51-7-15, except that such termination shall not become final until the expiration of the time for an appeal without an appeal having been taken or, in the event an appeal is taken, until final determination of the proceeding has been made by the courts.
     </p>
     <p>
      If upon the hearing provided for in this section, a petition is presented to the chancery court, or the chancellor in vacation, signed by a majority of the landowners owning one-third (1/3) of the land, or, one-third (1/3) of the landholders owning a majority of the land, praying that the improvements be made, it shall be the duty of the court or chancellor to make the order establishing the district, without further inquiry, if it appear that the establishment thereof be necessary for the promotion of public health and for agricultural purposes. However, if upon that day a petition signed by a majority of the landowners owning one-third (1/3) of the land, or one-third (1/3) of the landowners owning a majority of the land, be presented praying that the improvements be not made, it shall be the duty of the court or chancellor to so order, but if no such petition is filed it shall be the duty of the court or chancellor to investigate and to establish such district if he is of the opinion the establishment thereof will be to the advantage of the owners of real property therein, and is for the public benefit. The petition provided for therein may be signed by women, whether married or single, owning land in the proposed district, guardians may sign for their wards, and trustees, executors and administrators may sign for the estate represented by them; if the signature of any corporation thereto is attested by the corporate seal, the same shall be sufficient evidence of the assent of the corporation to said petition.

Such bonds shall be issued only with the approval of the chancery court and upon the same notice to landowners of the district given in the same manner as provided herein in Section 51-7-11, in connection with organization of the district. Such bonds, notes or other evidences of indebtedness shall bear a rate of interest not exceeding that allowed in Section 75-17-105, shall be issued in denominations of not less than Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00), shall be signed by the president of said master water management district and countersigned by the secretary; shall bear the seal of the district; may be made payable either within or without the state, to the persons or person to whom sold, or bearer, or bearer simply, at the discretion of the commissioners; may be validated in the manner provided by law for validation of bonds; may have attached interest coupons bearing the facsimile signatures of the president and secretary of the district; and shall be sold at public sale, subject to approval of the chancery court. If any protest against issuance of such bonds shall be filed, such protest shall be heard and determination made thereon by the chancery court; and appeals may be taken either by the commissioners or the person filing the protest from the judgment or order of the court, in the manner provided herein for other appeals from judgments or orders of the court in connection with said master water management districts.

    Assessments.

     <p>
      For the purposes of this chapter, including but not limited to the construction and maintenance of works of improvement, expenses of the board of commissioners, assessment of benefits, and for repayment of bonds and interest as provided herein, the commissioners of a master water management district shall have authority to assess the lands of the district in proportion to the benefits accruing to said lands; provided, however, that for the purpose of providing funds with which to clean out, restore, repair and rehabilitate the whole or any part of the drainage system of such district or for the purpose of cooperating with the United States or any agency thereof in such works, there may be imposed a uniform assessment by the commissioners of such master water management district or, upon resolution of said commissioners, by the commissioners of a drainage or subdrainage district on each acre of unsubdivided land lying within the master district and a uniform assessment by lot on subdivided land lying within the master district and the records required in this chapter shall show the amount of the assessment in lieu of the amount of benefits accruing to each tract. Taxes levied hereunder are hereby declared to be taxes for maintenance purposes and shall not diminish in any manner the amount of assessed benefits in any such district which is otherwise available for the payment of any outstanding bonds of such district.
     </p>
     <p>
      The assessments provided for in this section may be made even though evidences of indebtedness have been issued or validated or both prior thereto, but the lien of the holders of any such indebtedness shall not be impaired thereby. No assessments shall be made against lands owned by the State of Mississippi or any political subdivision thereof, or lands owned by the United States of America or any agency thereof. Such assessment shall be made in such manner as to clearly show the name of the owner and the description of the lands against which the assessment is made. When the assessment has been made, the assessment roll shall be filed with the chancery clerk and notice of such assessment shall be given in the same manner that notice is given for other purposes as provided in Section 51-7-11. Such notice of assessment shall include the date which the chancellor has set for hearing of any protest of such assessment. Such protest shall affect only the assessment against the person or persons making the protest. The court on said date, or within thirty (30) days thereafter, shall pass upon the assessment roll; and he shall have the authority to approve the roll, order its revision, or modify same, within his discretion. After said roll has been approved by the court, copies thereof certified by the secretary of the board of commissioners shall be transmitted to the boards of supervisors and the tax collectors of the counties within which the lands of said master water management district are located, and the said boards of supervisors shall make the levy for taxes upon the said lands on said assessment roll on such percentage basis as is requested by the board of commissioners. If any landowners or the board of commissioners are aggrieved at any assessment approved by the chancellor, they shall have the right of appeal from the order of the chancellor as provided for under Section 51-7-23, but such appeal shall not stay the collection of any tax levied on such assessment. The tax collectors of the respective counties in which such lands are located shall collect the taxes at the regular times provided by law for the collection of real estate taxes, and shall remit such collections to the secretary of said district within thirty (30) days after expiration of the time provided for payment thereof. All provisions of law for the sale of land for delinquent ad valorem taxes shall be applicable in effecting collection of any delinquent taxes which may be due under provisions of this chapter, and suit may be maintained against any delinquent taxpayer hereunder in the manner provided by law. All liabilities and penalties pertaining to responsibilities and duties of the tax collector generally shall be applicable hereunder.

      At any time within three (3) years after the completion of construction of improvements for which assessment has been made under the provisions hereof, or within six (6) months after the effective date of this section, whichever is later, any landowner or group of landowners upon whose lands the original assessment or benefits were improperly or erroneously made may file an action in the chancery court of proper jurisdiction requesting modification or removal of such assessments. Upon a hearing being had on such action the chancellor shall make such findings of fact as the evidence adduced may require and may either confirm the assessments as originally made or may order such changes therein as may be required so that the total cost of the works as constructed may be borne by those lands in the district actually benefited thereby in proportion to the benefits actually conferred thereon by such improvements except as otherwise provided in this section. Such order may be made even though evidences of indebtedness have been issued and validated prior thereto, but the lien of the holders of any such indebtedness shall not be impaired thereby.

     <p>
      If the commissioners at any time either before or after the organization of the district find that other land not embraced within the boundaries of the district will be benefited by the proposed improvement or improvements already made, they shall assess the estimated benefit to such lands and shall specially report to the chancery court, or chancellor in vacation, the assessments which they have made on land beyond the boundaries of the district, as already established. It shall thereupon be the duty of the clerk of the chancery court to give notice by two (2) weekly insertions in a newspaper published in the county where such lands lie, describing the additional lands which have been assessed. The owners of real property so assessed shall be allowed not less than ten (10) days after the last required publication of such notice in which to file with the clerk of the chancery court in writing their protest against being so assessed, or included within the district. The chancery court, or chancellor in vacation, shall, within ninety (90) days, investigate the question whether the lands beyond the boundaries of the district so assessed by the commissioners will in fact be benefited by the making of the improvement, and from its finding in that regard, either the property owner or the commissioners may, within twenty (20) days, appeal to the supreme court. If the finding is in favor of the commissioners, the limits of the district shall be extended so as to embrace any lands that may be benefited by the making of the improvement.

      The commissioners may, at any time after the organization of the district, acquire permanent easements and rights of way for constructing, clearing, improving, and maintaining channels, canals and ditches within the district, in accordance with the provisions of Section 51-29-39, insofar as such provisions may be applicable. It shall not be necessary to personally summon the landowners affected, but in lieu thereof notice may be given by publication in the same manner as provided by Section 51-7-11, on plans and specifications of the district filed with the chancery clerk. The findings of the court, or chancellor in vacation, shall be final and have the force and effect of a judgment, from which appeal may be taken within twenty (20) days to the supreme court of the state, either by the property owner or by the commissioners of the district.

     <p>
      There is created the Pearl River Industrial Commission, composed of Hinds, Leake, Madison, Neshoba, Rankin and such other counties in the state through which or bordering which the Pearl River runs. The Governor shall appoint one (1) member to the commission from each county from a list of three (3) names to be submitted by the board of supervisors in each participating county. The three (3) names submitted by the board of supervisors of Madison County and the board of supervisors of Rankin County shall be the names of persons who reside on and are holders of residential leases from the Pearl River Valley Water Supply District that are located in Madison County and Rankin County, respectively, or who reside in established subdivisions in Madison County and Rankin County, respectively, in which some of the residential property of the subdivision is leased from the Pearl River Valley Water Supply District. In his appointment the Governor shall designate the chairman and vice chairman of the commission. Each member of the commission shall serve for a term concurrent with that of the Governor. The board of supervisors in any county through which or by which the Pearl River runs, other than those counties named above, may bring that county in as a member of the commission by resolution presented to the Governor; and the board of supervisors in such county may, in its discretion, call an election before taking such action, the election to be held as nearly as possible in the same manner other elections are held in the county.

     <p>
      The member appointed from Madison County who is serving on July 1, 2012, shall continue to serve until January 1, 2013, after which date the Governor shall appoint a member from Madison County who meets the residency requirements of this section.

       This statute is not unconstitutional as conferring on the judiciary authority to answer legislative questions, or as a local law on a matter which may be provided for only by general laws, or as authorizing the permanent obstruction of navigable waters of the state, or as violating the requirement that taxation be equal and uniform throughout the state, or as empowering the water district to condemn property and rent or sell it for private use.

      It is hereby declared, as a matter of legislative determination, that the waterways and surface waters of the state are among its basic resources, that the overflow and surface waters of the state have not heretofore been conserved to realize their full beneficial use, that the preservation, conservation, storage, and control of such waters are necessary to insure an adequate, sanitary water supply at all times, to promote the balanced economic development of the state, and to aid in flood control, conservation and development of state forests, irrigation of lands needing irrigation, and pollution abatement. It is further determined and declared that the preservation, conservation, storage, and control of the waters of the Pearl River and its tributaries and its overflow waters for domestic, municipal, commercial, industrial, agricultural, and manufacturing purposes, for recreational uses, for flood control, timber development, irrigation, and pollution abatement are, as a matter of public policy, for the general welfare of the entire people of the state.

       In creating the Pearl River Valley Water Supply District, the legislature did not intend to establish a state agency with authority to deprive a citizen of the enjoyment of his property, unless the same was necessary to accomplish some lawful purpose of the act.

       The Pearl River Valley Water Supply District is an agency of the state, and therefore its actions in promulgating rules and regulations for carrying out its purposes are subject to judicial review.

       Where plaintiff’s property was surrounded by that of a public water supply district so that there was no access to the property other than across the lands of the district, the action of the district in denying the plaintiff access to his land was arbitrary, and the district was directed to designate a point upon its lands abutting a public road as a way of necessity for ingress and egress to plaintiff’s land.

      The Pearl River Industrial Commission, acting through it members who favor bringing the counties they represent into the Pearl River Valley Water Supply District, shall petition the chancery court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County to organize and establish the Pearl River Valley Water Supply District and shall set forth in the petition:
     </p>
     <p>
      The counties to be included in the Pearl River Valley Water Supply District. Any county through which the Pearl River runs or which borders on the Pearl River may be included in the district.
     </p>
     <p>
      The fact that a preliminary report or study to determine the engineering feasibility of constructing a dam and reservoir in the basin of Pearl River has been made by a competent engineer or engineering firm and that such study or report shows that the construction of such facilities is feasible for water conservation or supply or for any of the other purposes or services contemplated by the legislative declaration of public policy in this article.
     </p>
     <p>
      The necessity and desirability for the construction of such facilities.
     </p>
     <p>
      A general description of the purposes of the contemplated works, and a general description of the plan including the lands to be overflowed or otherwise affected thereby, and maps or plats showing the general location of the reservoir and dam and related facilities. The word “project” when used herein shall mean the general plan and purposes of the Pearl River Valley Water Supply District, including its physical properties, as set out in this petition to the chancery court; and the words “project area” shall mean the physical location of the reservoir, dam, and related facilities as shown on the plats filed with the chancery court and shall include and be limited to an area of one mile from the shore line of the reservoir at high water. The words “related facilities” as used in this article shall mean the facilities indicated on said maps or plats filed with the chancery court or otherwise explained in the pleadings filed with the chancery court and shall include property, land, or areas of land adjacent to, or in the vicinity of, said reservoir or dam and within a distance of one mile from the high water mark of the proposed shore line of said reservoir as shown on said map, which may be acquired, owned, rented, leased, or sold by the district in connection with the recreational or industrial development and use of the project.
     </p>
     <p>
      The petition shall be filed with as many copies as there are parties defendant. A copy of the preliminary report or study shall be attached to the original and each copy of the petition as an exhibit.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of water commissioners shall be made a party defendant, and the chancery clerk shall furnish the board of water commissioners with a copy of the petition with attached exhibits. Each county named in the petition shall be joined as a party defendant by service of process on the president of the board of supervisors thereof, and the chancery clerk shall furnish a copy of the petition to each such president. Whenever any municipality having a population according to the most recent federal census of ten thousand (10,000) or more is included in such proposed district, such municipality shall be made a party defendant.
     </p>
     <p>
      It shall not be necessary that any land owners in the counties to be included in said proposed district be named in the petition, or made parties defendant. The chancellor of the chancery court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi, shall have jurisdiction of the entire water supply district and project area for the purposes of this article. Such jurisdiction may be exercised by the chancellor in term time or in vacation, as provided in this article.

     <p>
      The board of water commissioners shall make a written report on the preliminary study or plans furnished them and shall, within thirty days after receipt of the said study, file such report with the chancery court setting forth their recommendations concerning the proposed water supply district. After the filing of the report of the board of water commissioners, and upon motion of the petitioners, the chancellor shall enter an order fixing the date for a hearing of the cause on the original petition, the exhibit, the report and recommendations of the board of water commissioners, and any answers filed or other pleadings. The chancery clerk shall give notice of such hearing to all persons interested by posting notices thereof at the door of the courthouse of the county or counties in which the district is situated and in at least ten public places in said proposed district, and also by publishing said notice at least once a week for three consecutive weeks in a newspaper published in Hinds County and in a newspaper published in each of the other counties proposed to be included in such water supply district. If there is no newspaper published in any such county, then it shall be sufficient to publish said notice in a newspaper having a general circulation in such county. Such notice shall be addressed to the property owners and qualified electors of such proposed district and all other persons interested, shall state when and in what court said petition was and is filed, shall state the counties included in such district, and shall command all such persons to appear before the chancery court, or the chancellor in vacation, at the Chancery Court Building in the First Judicial District of Hinds County, upon the date fixed by the chancellor to show cause, if any they can, why the proposed water supply district should not be organized and established as prayed for in said petition. The date of such hearing shall not be less than twenty-one days nor more than forty days after the last publication of such notice. It shall be sufficient in describing the lands to be included in the water supply district to name the counties to be included therein in the publication or notice hereinbefore mentioned.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the court or chancellor finds that the notice or publication was not given as provided for in this article, it shall not thereby lose jurisdiction, but the court or chancellor shall order due publication or notice to be given and shall continue the hearing until such publication or notice shall be properly given, and the court or chancellor shall thereupon proceed as though publication or notice had been properly given in the first instance.

      The chancery court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County may hear the petition at any term thereof, or the chancellor of said court may fix a time to hear such petition at any time in vacation, and may determine all matters pertaining thereto, may adjourn the hearing from time to time, and may continue the case for want of sufficient notice or other good cause. If said petition shall prove defective in any manner, the petitioners, upon motion, shall be permitted to amend the same.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon the day set for hearing said petition, or a day to which same may be continued by the court or chancellor, all parties interested may appear and contest the same. If upon the hearing of such petition, it is found that such project is feasible from an engineering standpoint and practical, and if the creation of the water supply district under the terms of this article would meet a public necessity both local and statewide and would be conducive to the public welfare of the state as a whole, such court or chancellor shall so find and shall make and enter an order upon the minutes of the said chancery court stating that the said district to be known as the Pearl River Valley Water Supply District, should be organized subject to all of the terms and provisions of this article.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the chancellor finds that the proposed water supply district should not be organized, he shall dismiss the proceedings, and the costs shall be paid by the Pearl River Industrial Commission.

    Powers of district.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The Pearl River Valley Water Supply District through its board of directors is hereby empowered:
     </p>
     <p>
      To impound overflow water and the surface water of the Pearl River or its tributaries within the project area, within or without this district at the place or places and in the amount as may be approved by the Office of Land and Water Resources of the State of Mississippi, by the construction of a dam or dams, reservoir or reservoirs, works, plants, and any other necessary or useful related facilities contemplated and described as a part of the project within or without the district, to control, store, and preserve these waters, and to use, distribute, and sell the same. The Pearl River Valley Water Supply District is also empowered to construct or otherwise acquire within the project area all works, plants, or other facilities necessary or useful to the project for the purpose of processing the water and transporting it to cities and others for domestic, municipal, commercial, industrial, agricultural, and manufacturing purposes and is hereby given the power to control open channels for water delivery purposes.
     </p>
     <p>
      To acquire and develop any other available water necessary or useful to the project and to construct, acquire, and develop all facilities within the project area deemed necessary or useful with respect thereto.
     </p>
     <p>
      To prevent or aid in the prevention of damage to person or property from the waters of the Pearl River or any of its tributaries.

     </p>
     <p>
      To acquire by purchase, lease, gift, or in any other manner (otherwise than by condemnation) and to maintain, use, and operate all property of any kind, real, personal, or mixed, or any interest therein within the project area, within or without the boundaries of the district, necessary for the project and convenient to the exercise of the powers, rights, privileges, and functions conferred upon the district by this article.
     </p>
     <p>
      To acquire by condemnation all property of any kind, real, personal, or mixed, or any interest therein within the project area not exceeding one-quarter (1/4) mile from the outside line of the three hundred (300) feet above sea level contour on each side of Pearl River except as provided for rights-of-way under subsection (g) of this section, within or without the boundaries of the district, necessary for the project and the exercise of the powers, rights, privileges, and functions conferred upon the district by this article, according to the procedure provided by law for the condemnation of lands or other property taken for rights-of-way or other purposes by railroads, telephone, or telegraph companies. For the purposes of carrying out this article, the right of eminent domain of the district shall be superior and dominant to the right of eminent domain of railroad, telegraph, telephone, gas, power, and other companies or corporations, and shall be sufficient to enable the acquisition of county roads, state highways, or other public property in the project area and the acquisition, or relocation, of the above mentioned utility property in the project area; however, Mississippi Highway 43 as presently located shall be kept open as part of the state highway system. The cost of right-of-way purchases, rerouting, and elevating all other county maintained roads affected by construction of the reservoir shall be borne by the water district, and new construction shall be of equal quality as in roads existing as of May 5, 1958. The amount and character of interest in land, other property, and easements thus to be acquired shall be determined by the board of directors, and their determination shall be conclusive and shall not be subject to attack in the absence of manifold abuse of discretion or fraud on the part of such board in making such determination. However,
     </p>
     <p>
      In acquiring lands, either by negotiation or condemnation, the district shall not acquire minerals or royalties within the project area; sand and gravel shall not be considered as minerals within the meaning of this section; and

     <p>
      No person or persons owning the drilling rights or the right to share in production shall be prevented from exploring, developing, or producing oil or gas with necessary rights-of-way for ingress and egress, pipe lines, and other means of transporting these products by reason of the inclusion of such lands or mineral interests within the project area, whether below or above the water line; but any such activities shall be under such reasonable regulations by the board of directors as will adequately protect the reservoir; and
     </p>
     <p>
      In drilling and developing, these persons are hereby vested with a special right to have the mineral interest integrated and their lands developed in such drilling unit or units as the State Oil and Gas Board shall establish after due consideration of the rights of all of the owners to be included in the drilling unit.
     </p>
     <p>
      Moreover, where any site or plot of land is to be rented, leased, or sold to any person, firm, or corporation for the purpose of operating recreational facilities thereon for profit, then the board shall, by resolution, specify the terms and conditions of the sale, rental, or lease, and shall advertise for public bids thereon. When bids are received, they shall be publicly opened by the board, and the board shall thereupon determine the highest and best bid submitted and shall immediately notify the former owner of the site or plot of the amount, terms, and conditions of the highest and best bid. The former owner of the site or plot shall have the exclusive right at his option, for a period of thirty (30) days after the determination of the highest and best bid by the board, to rent, lease, or purchase said site or plot of land by meeting such highest and best bid and by complying with all terms and conditions of the renting, leasing, or sale as specified by the board. However, the board shall not in any event rent, lease, or sell to any former owner more land than was taken from the former owner for the construction of the project, or one-quarter (1/4) mile of shoreline, whichever is the lesser. If this option is not exercised by the former owner within a period of thirty (30) days, then the board shall accept the highest and best bid submitted.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any bona fide, resident householder, actually living or maintaining a residence on land taken by the district by condemnation shall have the right to repurchase not exceeding forty (40) acres of his former land or other available land from the board of directors for a price not exceeding the price paid for condemning his land.
     </p>
     <p>
      To require the necessary relocation of roads and highways, railroad, telephone, and telegraph lines and properties, electric power lines, gas pipelines and mains and facilities in the project area, or to require the anchoring or other protection of any of these, provided due compensation is first paid the owners thereof or agreement is had with the owners regarding the payment of the cost of the relocation. It is further provided that the district is hereby authorized to acquire easements or rights-of-way in or outside of the project area for the relocation of the roads, highways, railroad, telephone, and telegraph lines and properties, electric power lines, gas pipelines and mains and facilities, and to convey the same to the owners thereof in connection with the relocation as a part of the construction of the project; however, the directors of the district shall not close any public access road to the reservoir existing prior to the construction of the reservoir unless the board of supervisors of the county in which the road is located agrees.
     </p>
     <p>

For all services in connection with the issuance of bonds as provided in this article, the attorney’s fee shall not exceed one-quarter of one percent (1/4 of 1%) of the principal amount of said bonds. For any other services, only reasonable compensation shall be paid for these services. The board shall have the right to employ a general manager, who shall, at the discretion of the board, have the power to employ and discharge employees. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it may employ fiscal agents or advisors in connection with its financing program and in connection with the issuance of its bonds.

Any such contract may be upon any terms and for any time as the parties may agree, and it may provide that it shall continue in effect until bonds specified therein and refunding bonds issued in lieu of these bonds are paid. Any contract with any political subdivision shall be binding upon said political subdivision according to its terms, and any municipalities or other political subdivisions shall have the power to enter into such contracts as in the discretion of the governing authorities thereof would be to the best interest of the people of the municipality or other political subdivision. These contracts may include, within the discretion of the governing authorities, a pledge of the full faith and credit of the political subdivisions for the performance thereof.

      <li id="t51c09s51-9-122ol11">
       At any time more than fifteen (15) years after the commencement date of any residential lease from the district, the leaseholder shall have the option to renew and extend the lease for a new sixty-year term by giving the district notice of his exercise of this option to renew.
      </li>
      <li id="t51c09s51-9-122ol12">
       At any time after the first fifteen (15) years of the term of any residential lease, the then present lessee may obtain from the district a new sixty-year lease on the terms and conditions contained in the then current lease form approved for use in residential leases with the exception of rent. Rent under such sixty-year leases will be payable on the same annual payment date as rent under the lease being renewed. The maximum annual rental under the new lease will be determined by the district as follows:

        <li id="t51c09s51-9-122ol12a">
         Renewal of Leases with Fixed Rental (non-escalating): The district will recompute the annual rental due under the lease being renewed as if the lease had contained annual rents at the fixed amount stated in the lease for the first ten-year period, escalating thereafter at ten percent (10%), rounded to the nearest Five Dollars ($5.00), every five-year period. The annual rental which would have been payable as of the renewal date will be the annual rent payable for the first ten-year period of the renewed lease. Annual rental will escalate thereafter at ten percent (10%), rounded to the nearest Five Dollars ($5.00), every five (5) years. Recomputed annual rental will be payable from and after the first day of the renewed lease term and not for the period prior to renewal.
        </li>
        <li id="t51c09s51-9-122ol12b">
         Renewal of Leases with Escalating Rental: Annual rental will remain payable in accordance with the terms of the lease being renewed with rental continuing to escalate at ten percent (10%), rounded to the nearest Five Dollars ($5.00), every five (5) years during the renewed term.

       At any time a lessee is found to be in default or in breach of the terms and conditions contained in the lease, the district shall give thirty (30) days written notice to such lessee before terminating the lease. Such notice shall be by certified mail and shall specifically state the default or breach. If the lessee does not cure the default or breach within thirty (30) days of such notice, then the district shall give written notice to the holder of any mortgage or deed of trust on the leasehold and such holder shall thereupon have thirty (30) days to cure the default or breach before the lease is terminated.

   The chancellor erred in permanently enjoining a water supply district, which was authorized and empowered by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t51c09s51-9-133" target="_self">51-9-133</a></cite> to issue bonds for the purpose of paying the cost of acquiring, owning, constructing, operating, repairing and maintaining a reservoir, from using any state ad valorem tax proceeds diverted to the district by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t51c09s51-9-131" target="_self">51-9-131</a></cite> for any purpose other than paying, prepaying, redeeming, or retiring bonds, and further erred in enjoining the district from making a special levy under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t51c09s51-9-139" target="_self">51-9-139</a></cite> in any year that the state ad valorem taxes paid to the district exceeded the amount of the district’s debt service, since the water supply district was not required to use state ad valorem tax proceeds only for purposes of retirement of the district’s bonded indebtedness, and, if there were not a sufficient amount remaining from those funds after deduction of the cost of operating and maintaining the project and related facilities, and application of the balance to the retirement of the bonds, the board of directors had authority to assess an additional special levy of not more than two mills also to be applied toward the retirement of bonds.

The trust agreement may contain provision for the issuance of additional bonds for any of the purposes authorized by this article, which shall be secured by the revenues pledged thereunder for such bonds to the extent provided therein. The trust agreement may include provisions to the effect that if there is any default in the payment of principal or interest on any of said bonds, any court having jurisdiction of the action may appoint a receiver to administer the properties and facilities of the district described in the trust agreement, on behalf of the district, including authority to sell or make contracts for the sale of any services, facilities, or commodities of the district or to renew such contracts, subject to the approval of the court appointing said receiver; and with power to provide for the payment of such bonds outstanding, or the payment of operating expenses, and to apply the income and revenues to the payment of said bonds and interest thereon in accordance with the resolution of the board of directors authorizing the issuance of such bonds and said trust agreement. The fee for the services of any corporate trustee shall not exceed the normal charges for acting as paying agent plus any additional amount or amounts allowed by the court as the reasonable value of services rendered by the corporate trustee upon default in the payment of principal and interest on the bonds.

     <p>
      Payments by any public agency for water supplies from the waterworks or water supply system owned or operated by the district shall be made from the gross receipts or revenues of the public agency’s waterworks, water supply system, or of its combined waterworks, water supply, sewerage and sewage disposal systems, as may be prescribed in the contract between the public agency and the district, its successors or assigns, or as otherwise authorized by law. Such payments shall constitute an operating expense of the system or systems whose revenues are thus to be applied.

       § 51-9-207.
    Issuance of refunding bonds.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The district may issue refunding bonds for the purpose of paying any of its bonds at or prior to maturity or upon acceleration or redemption. Refunding bonds may be issued at such time prior to the maturity or redemption of the refunded bonds as the district deems to be in the public interest, without notice and without an election on the question of the issuance thereof. The refunding bonds may be issued in sufficient amounts to pay or provide the principal of the bonds being refunded, together with any redemption premium thereon, any interest accrued or to accrue to the date of payment of such bonds, the expenses of issue of the refunding bonds, the expenses of redeeming the bonds being refunded and such reserves for debt service or other capital or current expenses from the proceeds of such refunding bonds as may be required by the resolution, trust indenture or other security instruments. The issue of refunding bonds, the maturities and other details thereof, the security therefor, the rights of the holders and the rights, duties and obligations of the district in respect of the same shall be governed by the provisions of this act relating to the issue of bonds other than refunding bonds insofar as the same may be applicable. Any such refunding may be effected, whether the obligations to be refunded shall have then matured or shall thereafter mature, either by the exchange of the refunding bonds for the obligations to be refunded thereby with the consent of the holders of the obligations so to be refunded, or by sale of the refunding bonds and the application of the proceeds thereof to the payment of the obligations proposed to be refunded thereby, and regardless of whether the obligations proposed to be refunded shall be payable on the same date or different dates or shall be due serially or otherwise.

Such notice shall be published at least once in a newspaper or newspapers having a general circulation within the geographical boundaries of each of the public agencies to whose taxpayers the notice is addressed. Such validation proceedings shall be instituted in the First Judicial District of the Chancery Court of Hinds County.

     </p>
     <p>
      Covenant as to the mortgage or pledge of or the grant of a security interest in any real or personal property and all or any part of the revenues from any water treatment, waterworks or water supply systems or any part thereof or any revenue-producing contract or contracts made by the district with any person to secure the payment of bonds, subject to such agreements with the registered owners of bonds as may then exist.
     </p>
     <p>
      Covenant as to the custody, collection, securing, investment and payment of any revenues, assets, moneys, funds or property with respect to which the district may have any rights or interest.
     </p>
     <p>
      Covenant as to the purposes to which the proceeds from the sale of any bonds then or thereafter to be issued may be applied, and the pledge of such proceeds to secure the payment of the bonds.
     </p>

     <p>
      Execute all instruments necessary or convenient in the exercise of the powers herein granted or in the performance of covenants or duties, which may contain such covenants and provisions as any purchaser of the bonds of the district may reasonably require.

      The district may, in any authorizing resolution of the board of directors, trust indenture or other security instrument relating to its bonds, provide for the appointment of a trustee who shall have such powers as are provided therein to represent the registered owners of any issue of bonds in the enforcement or protection of their rights under any such resolution, trust indenture or security instrument.

Such receiver may exercise any power as may be granted in any such resolution, trust indenture or security instrument to enter upon and take possession of, acquire, construct or reconstruct or operate and maintain such collection facilities or treatment facilities, fix, charge, collect, enforce and receive all revenues derived from such collection facilities or treatment facilities and perform the public duties and carry out the contracts and obligations of the district in the same manner as the district itself might do, all under the direction of such court.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The following provisions related to the Lower Pearl River Restoration Project (“project”) are contingent upon the development of an agreement, or an amendment to the existing agreement, between the United States Army, Corps of Engineers (“USACOE”), the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (“MDEQ”), the Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks (“DWFP”) and the district, removing the district from the agreement, and possibly adding a new cooperating partner or partners and possibly removing the MDEQ and/or the DWFP from the agreement.

      From and after July 1, 2018, the project, currently being managed as a joint effort of the USACOE, the MDEQ, the DWFP, and the district, shall continue as per existing agreements, which may be amended to reflect the dissolution of the district and its removal from those agreements. The obligations of the district under the current agreements for the project may be assumed by the MDEQ, or other entity, as the designated state entity for the continuing obligation of maintenance of the water control structures as set forth in the original agreements. The parties to the agreement may identify necessary maintenance activities needed to preserve the integrity of project structures and other ordinary maintenance activities as the parties may agree need to be performed. Funding to perform those maintenance activities shall come from the Lower Pearl trust account currently on deposit with a depository or depositories in the name of the Pearl River Basin Development District, which funds are a special fund set aside solely for the operation and maintenance of the project. From and after July 1, 2018, the parties to the agreement, may assume ownership, in trust, of those funds, and the funds shall be known as the “Lower Pearl River Restoration Trust Fund.” Monies from this fund shall be a special fund set aside for the purpose(s) set forth in the amended or reformed agreement between the parties and shall not lapse into the State General Fund, and may not be expended for any purpose other than operation and maintenance activities under the purview of the project.

     <p>
      The Tombigbee River Valley Water Management District through its board of directors is hereby empowered:
     </p>
     <p>
      To develop, in conjunction with the United States Army Corps of Engineers, United States Secretary of Agriculture, or with the head of any other federal or state agency as may be involved, plans for public works of improvement for the prevention of floodwater damage, or the conservation, development, navigation, utilization and disposal of water, including the impoundment, diversion, flowage and distribution of waters for beneficial use as defined in Chapter 3 of this title.
     </p>
     <p>
      To enter into agreements with the United States of America, as represented by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, to meet the requirements of local cooperation for flood control and navigation projects as set out in House Document No. 167, 84th Congress, First Session, as authorized by Public Law 85-500, 85th Congress, dated July 3, 1958, as amended, and House Document No. 486, 79th Congress, Second Session, as approved by Public Law 525, 79th Congress, as amended.
     </p>
     <p>

     </p>
     <p>
      To acquire by condemnation all property of any kind, real, personal, or mixed, or any interest therein, within or without the boundaries of the district, necessary for the projects and the exercise of the powers, rights, privileges and functions conferred upon the district by this article, according to the procedure provided by law for the condemnation of lands or other property taken for rights-of-way or other purposes by railroads, telephone, or telegraph companies, and according to the provisions of Section 29-1-1. For the purposes of this article the right of eminent domain of the district shall be superior and dominant to the right of eminent domain of railroad, telegraph, telephone, gas, power and other companies or corporations and shall be sufficient to enable the acquisition of county roads, state highways, or other public property in the project area, and the acquisition or relocation of this property in the project area. The cost of right-of-way purchases, rerouting and elevating all other county-maintained roads affected by construction shall be borne by the water management district, and new construction shall be of equal quality as in roads existing as of May 1, 1962. The county in which the work is done may assist in these costs if the board of supervisors desires.
     </p>
     <p>
      The amount and character of interest in land, other property, and easements to be acquired shall be determined by the board of directors, and their determination shall be conclusive and shall not be subject to attack in the absence of manifold abuse of discretion or fraud on the part of such board in making such determination. However,
     </p>
     <p>
      In acquiring lands, either by negotiation or condemnation, the district shall not acquire minerals or royalties within the project area; sand and gravel shall not be considered as minerals within the meaning of this section; and

      No person or persons owning the drilling rights or the right to share in production shall be prevented from exploring, developing, or producing oil or gas with necessary rights-of-way for ingress and egress, pipelines, and other means of transporting these products by reason of the inclusion of the lands or mineral interests within the project area, whether below or above the waterline, but any activities shall be under reasonable regulations by the board of directors that will adequately protect the project; and
     </p>
     <p>
      In drilling and developing, these persons are hereby vested with a special right to have mineral interests integrated and their lands developed in the drilling unit or units that the State Oil and Gas Board shall establish after due consideration of the rights of all owners to be included in the drilling unit.
     </p>
     <p>

      <p>
       Miss. Code Section 51-13-111(x) allows Tombigbee River Valley Water Management District to enter into agreement with private landowner whereby District conveys to him property it no longer needs in exchange for easements it does need to complete project; however, this exchange could be made only if fair market value of easements to be acquired by District is equal to or greater than fair market value of land to be conveyed by it to private landowner; otherwise, exchange could only be made if private landowner paid to District difference in two fair market prices. 1993 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 233.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Tombigbee River Valley Water Management District finds on its minutes that easements to be acquired from private landowner are necessary for project and convenient to exercise of District’s powers, and if it further finds that lands previously conveyed to it by private landowner are no longer necessary for project or useful to District, and, if District finds that fair market value of easements to be obtained is equal to or greater than fair market value of lands to be conveyed, then exchange may be made whereby District reconveys these lands to private landowner in exchange for easements it needs. 1993 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 233.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Tombigbee River Valley Water Management District may acquire property by first contacting the Secretary of State in accordance with Section 29-1-1(6); if no suitable state-held land is available, then the District may identify suitable property and begin negotiations in compliance with Section 43-37-3. 2003 Miss.

     <p>
      All such bonds provided for by Section 51-13-123 shall be negotiable instruments within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code of this state, shall be lithographed or engraved and printed in two (2) or more colors to prevent counterfeiting, shall be in denominations of not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) nor more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), shall be registered as issued, and shall be numbered in a regular series from one (1) upward. Each such bond shall specify on its face the purpose for which it was issued and the total amount authorized to be issued, it shall be payable to bearer, and the interest to accrue thereon shall be evidenced by proper coupons to be attached thereto. Such bonds shall bear interest at such rate or rates, not exceeding six percent (6%) per annum, as may be determined by the sale of such bonds. They shall mature annually in such amounts and at such times as shall be provided by the resolution of the board of directors. However, no bond shall have a longer maturity than forty (40) years from January 1, 1965, and the first maturity date thereof shall be not more than five (5) years from the date of such bonds. The denomination, form and place or places of payment of such bonds shall be fixed in the resolution of the board of directors of the district. Such bonds shall be signed by the president and secretary of such board with the seal of the district affixed thereto, but the coupons may bear only the facsimile signatures of such president and secretary. All interest accruing on such bonds so issued shall be payable semiannually, except that the first interest coupon attached to any such bond may be for a period not exceeding one (1) year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such bonds may be called in, paid and redeemed in inverse numerical order on any interest date prior to maturity, upon not less than thirty (30) days’ notice to the paying agent or agents designated in such bonds, and at such premium as may be designated in such bonds. In no case shall any premiums exceed six percent (6%) of the face value of such bonds.
     </p>
     <p>
      All such bonds shall contain in substance a statement to the effect that they are secured solely by a pledge of the avails of the two (2) mills ad valorem tax levy provided for in Section 51-13-121, or so much thereof as may be necessary therefor, and of the net revenues as hereinabove defined or so much thereof as may be necessary therefor, and that they do not constitute general obligations of the state of Mississippi or of the counties comprising said district, and are not secured by a pledge of the full faith, credit and resources of said state or of such counties.
     </p>
     <p>
      All such bonds as provided for herein shall be sold at public sale as now provided by law. No such sale shall be at a price so low as to require the payment of interest on the money received therefor at more than six percent (6%) per annum computed with relation to the absolute maturity of the bonds, in accordance with standard tables of bond values, excluding from such computation the amount of any premium to be paid on redemption of any bonds prior to maturity.
     </p>
     <p>
      This article shall be full and complete authority for the issuance of the bonds provided for herein, and no restriction or limitation otherwise prescribed by law shall apply herein.

      Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, bonds referred to hereinabove may be issued pursuant to the supplemental powers and authorizations conferred by the provisions of the Registered Bond Act, being Sections 31-21-1 through 31-21-7.

      The board of water commissioners shall file a written answer to the petition within thirty days after such service. After the filing of the answer of the board of water commissioners, and upon motion of the petitioners, the chancellor shall enter an order fixing the date for a hearing of the cause on the original petition, the exhibits, the answer of the board of water commissioners, and any other answers filed or other pleadings. The chancery clerk shall give notice of such hearing to all persons interested by posting notices thereof at the door of the courthouse of the county or counties in which the district is situated and in at least ten public places in said proposed district, and also by publishing said notice at least once a week for three consecutive weeks in a newspaper published in each of the counties proposed to be included in such waterway district. If there is no newspaper published in any such county, then it shall be sufficient to publish said notice in a newspaper having a general circulation in such county. Such notice shall be addressed to the property owners and qualified electors of such proposed district and all other persons interested, shall state when and in what court said petition was and is filed, shall state the counties included in such district, and shall command all such persons to appear before the chancery court, or the chancellor in vacation, at the chancery court building of Forrest County upon the date fixed by the chancellor to show cause, if any they can, why the proposed waterway district should not be organized and established as prayed for in said petition. The date for such hearing shall not be less than twenty-one days nor more than forty days after the last publication of such notice. It shall be sufficient in describing the lands to be included in the waterway district to name the counties to be included therein in the publication or notice hereinbefore mentioned.

     <p>
      If the court or chancellor finds that the notice or publication was not given as provided for in this article, it shall not thereby lose jurisdiction, but the court or chancellor shall order due publication or notice to be given and shall continue the hearing until such publication or notice shall be properly given; and the court or chancellor shall thereupon proceed as though publication or notice had been properly given in the first instance.

    District funding.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In each county of the State of Mississippi which is a part of the Pat Harrison Waterway District, so long as funds are found to be necessary for the operation of the district by annual legislative approval of the district budget, the tax collector of such county shall pay into the depository selected by the water district for such purpose an amount to be determined as follows: each county shall pay a pro rata share (not to exceed the avails of one (1) mill through September 30, 1997, and not to exceed the avails of three-fourths (3/4) mill through September 30, 2005, and not to exceed seven-eighths (7/8) mill thereafter) of the annual district budget based on the proportion that the most recent total assessed valuation of the county bears to the most recent aggregate total assessed valuation of all the counties which comprise the district; provided, however, that any county bordering on the Gulf of Mexico which by action of the board of supervisors has created and authorized a port authority and which has been paying into the port authority the avails of a two-mill levy that was established under Section 27-39-3 shall pay an amount not to exceed one-tenth (1/10) mill through September 30, 2005, and not to exceed two-tenths (2/10) mill thereafter, of the total assessed valuation of the county to the Pat Harrison Waterway District pursuant to this section and the assessed valuation of that county shall not be considered when calculating each county’s pro rata share of the district’s budget. Of the amount paid by counties required to pay to the district an amount not to exceed seven-eighths (7/8) mill, an amount equivalent to the avails of one-eighth (1/8) mill shall be utilized to fund flood control, water management and other similar projects as requested by counties in the district. Of the amount paid by counties required to pay to the district an amount not to exceed two-tenths (2/10) mill, an amount equivalent to the avails of one-tenth (1/10) mill shall be utilized to fund flood control, water management and other similar projects as requested by counties in the district. It shall be the duty of the Pat Harrison Waterway District Board of Directors in the month of November annually upon receipt of the total assessed valuation of the member counties, certified by the Department of Revenue, to prepare a request to the board of supervisors of member counties to levy a tax using the formula herein established not to exceed the maximum number of mills authorized by this section.

The annual rental which would have been payable as of the renewal date will be the annual rent payable for the first ten-year period of the renewed lease. Annual rental will escalate thereafter at ten percent (10%), rounded to the nearest Five Dollars ($5.00), every five (5) years.

If the lessee does not cure the default or breach within thirty (30) days of such notice, then the district shall give written notice to the holder of any mortgage or deed of trust on the leasehold and such holder shall thereupon have thirty (30) days to cure the default or breach before the lease is terminated.

       § 51-29-5.
    Creation of drainage districts.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      When one-fourth (1/4) or more of the owners of real property within a proposed drainage district shall file a petition in the chancery court of the county to establish a drainage district to embrace their property, describing generally the region which it is intended shall be embraced within the district, it shall be the duty of the chancery clerk to immediately publish a notice in a newspaper having a circulation in the proposed district for two (2) successive insertions, directed to the owners of the land to be embraced in the proposed district, giving notice of the said petition and designating a date, not less than ten (10) days after the last publication of notice, at which a hearing may be had on said petition. Upon the date designated in the notice, or upon a subsequent day to which the matter may be continued, the chancery court or the chancellor in vacation shall hear all objections, if any are offered, to the organization of said district, and unless at the hearing a majority of the landowners owning half or more of the land proposed to be included in the proposed district shall object to the organization, further proceedings shall be had as hereinafter provided; but if such a majority shall protest, the court or chancellor shall not proceed with the organization of said district. If in either event it be determined by the court or chancellor to proceed with the organization of the proposed district, the court or chancellor shall enter an order appointing as temporary commissioners three (3) landowners of the territory proposed to be drained, who shall take the oath required by Section 268 of Article 14 of the Constitution of the state and give bond in the penalty of not less than One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) payable to the county, and whose term of office shall expire upon the permanent organization of the district. Said temporary commissioners shall immediately organize and select a competent engineer, who shall give bond payable to the county in a sum of not less than One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00), to be fixed by said commissioners for the faithful discharge of his duties, and who shall be liable upon such bond for negligence or incompetency causing loss to the county or district.
     </p>
     <p>
      The engineer shall proceed forthwith to make a survey and ascertain the region which will be benefited by the proposed improvement, giving a general idea of its character and the cost of drainage, and making such suggestions as to the size of the drainage ditches and the location as he may deem advisable.
     </p>
     <p>
      All expenses incident to the survey, legal expenses, and the cost of publication shall be paid by the county as the work progresses upon a proper showing; but all expenses incurred by the county shall be paid out of the proceeds of the first assessment levied under this chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Said temporary commissioners may, by and with the consent of the court or chancellor, for the purpose of prosecuting the preliminary work, paying the expenses incident to the survey, attorney’s fees, legal expenses, costs of publication, and other necessary expenses, borrow money at a rate of interest not exceeding that allowed in Section 75-17-105, and issue negotiable notes, certificates or other evidences of indebtedness therefor signed by the said three (3) temporary commissioners and payable either within or without the state to the person or persons from whom such money is borrowed, or bearer, or bearer simply, as said commissioners may elect. The said temporary commissioners may also issue to the engineer, or other persons who do the said preliminary work, negotiable evidences of debt signed by the three (3) said temporary commissioners, bearing interest at a rate not to exceed that allowed in Section 75-17-105. None of the said evidences of indebtedness so issued shall run for more than two (2) years, they shall be non-taxable, and said commissioners may pledge all assessments on the land proposed to be drained for the payment of said evidences of indebtedness. Said evidences of indebtedness may be paid off either out of any general fund of the drainage district if organized, or out of the proceeds of the first assessments levied under this chapter; but in the event the said district is not organized after said indebtedness has been incurred, then the board of supervisors may levy an acreage or an ad valorem tax against the lands embraced in said proposed drainage district in the manner hereinafter provided.

      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of the statutory procedure for creation of drainage districts is to obtain the opinions and votes of the majority of those affected, either in number or land ownership. Allison v. Camp Creek Drainage Dist., 211 Miss. 354, 51 So. 2d 743, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 364 (Miss. 1951).

      <p>
       An insolvent drainage district is not subject to having its affairs administered and wound up by the federal district court under the 1937 amendment to the Bankruptcy Act providing for the composition of indebtedness of drainage districts, in the absence of consent by the state that the district’s affairs may be so administered, which consent has not been granted by any act of the legislature. Evans v. Bankston, 196 Miss. 533, 18 So. 2d 301, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 228 (Miss. 1944).

       A drainage district is a creature of the legislature, and the district does not necessarily have the same rights to the use of natural water courses as drains that riparian owners would have. Northern Drainage Dist. v. Bolivar County, 111 Miss. 250, 71 So. 380, 1916 Miss. LEXIS 281 (Miss. 1916).

       Where a mass meeting of citizens decided to create a drainage district under this law and selected attorneys to draw necessary papers, etc., to secure such district and they prepare the papers and represent the petitioners and the district is created, the services of the attorneys are used and accepted, and they are entitled to a reasonable fee even though there was no express contract. Jones Bayou Drainage Dist. v. Sillers, Clark & Sillers, 129 Miss. 13, 91 So. 693, 1922 Miss. LEXIS 12 (Miss. 1922).

      </p>

       The chancery court obtaining jurisdiction of a drainage district does not lose its jurisdiction because the land embraced in the drainage district is subsequently placed in another county. Box v. Straight Bayou Drainage Dist., 121 Miss. 850, 84 So. 3, 1920 Miss. LEXIS 126 (Miss. 1920).

      </p>
      <p>
       Since Laws 1912, ch. 195, gave counties no voice in the appointment of engineers, an appointment on petition signed by attorneys for petitioners for the organization of the district was valid against collateral attack by a county.

       However, chancery court is not without jurisdiction to establish a drainage district because proceedings had originally been instituted in the court of another county. Equen v. Arterbury, 121 Miss. 76, 83 So. 406, 1919 Miss. LEXIS 150 (Miss. 1919).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is the province of the legislature to provide for the establishment of drainage districts, and the authority, as well as the procedure, for the creation of drainage districts is governed by statute. Equen v. Arterbury, 121 Miss. 76, 83 So. 406, 1919 Miss. LEXIS 150 (Miss. 1919).
      </p>
      <p>
       For the purpose of increasing land values and promoting health the legislature has power to provide for creation of necessary drainage districts and require counties expected to be benefited to pay at least the preliminary expense, regardless of reimbursement. Board of Sup'rs v. Grable, 111 Miss. 893, 72 So. 777, 1916 Miss. LEXIS 415 (Miss. 1916).

       That notice of hearing on petition for creation of a drainage district assumed, as was fact, that a majority of landowners had signed the petition, a thing to be judicially found, did not render void, after lapse of time to appeal, the decree organizing the district without further inquiry. Armistead v. Southworth, 139 Miss. 723, 104 So. 94, 1925 Miss. LEXIS 143 (Miss. 1925).

      <p>
       In organizing and financing new drainage districts, the theory of proportionate benefits is paramount, and actual resultant benefits are the justification for, and the limitation of, the assessments. Buchanan v. Red Banks Creek Drainage Dist., 205 Miss. 736, 39 So. 2d 321, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 463 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>

       Drainage assessments and taxes are charges against the land only; there is no personal liability on the part of the owner. Waits v. Black Bayou Drainage Dist., 186 Miss. 270, 185 So. 577, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 197 (Miss. 1939).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Under this section [Code 1942, § 4675] and other sections, and the Mississippi decisions, levies against land for drainage improvements are tax levies, and, accordingly, levies for the costs of an uncompleted drainage district were taxes rather than assessment levies and created preferential liens on mortgaged lands so as to bind the purchasers of such lands at foreclosure sale. Bank of Commerce &amp; Trust Co. v. Union Cent. Life Ins. Co., 94 F.2d 422, 1938 U.S. App. LEXIS 4428 (5th Cir. Miss.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">304 U.S. 570</cite>, <cite class="s_court">58 S. Ct. 1040</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">82 L. Ed. 1535</cite>, 1938 U.S. LEXIS 946 (U.S. 1938).

       Where a drainage district, in making an assessment of benefits to property within the district, resulting from the drainage system assessing the same land to different owners, one of whom is the real owner and the other has no title or interest in the land, equity has jurisdiction to cancel the assessment. Yazoo & M. V. R. Co. v. Lane Bayou Drainage Dist., 141 Miss. 542, 106 So. 774, 1926 Miss. LEXIS 453 (Miss. 1926).
      </p>
      <p>
       Assessment and levy of taxes against lands to pay preliminary expenses incurred in forming a drainage district is void where landowners in the proposed district are not given notice of such assessment and levy. Russell v. Mabry, 134 Miss. 239, 99 So. 2, 1924 Miss. LEXIS 273 (Miss. 1924).
      </p>
      <p>
       A new assessment of benefits by a drainage district is authorized where the lands assessed receive benefits additional to those considered on the first assessment. White v. Lake Cormorant Drainage Dist., 130 Miss. 351, 94 So. 235, 1922 Miss. LEXIS 220 (Miss. 1922).
      </p>
      <p>
       Money to be collected from the landowners of a drainage district is a local assessment and not a tax, and may be collected without submission of a bond issue. Huston v. Mayo, 120 Miss. 523, 82 So. 334, 1919 Miss. LEXIS 115 (Miss. 1919).
      </p>

    Hearing on engineer’s report.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      As soon as the engineer has completed his survey of the proposed drainage district, he shall make a report thereof to the said temporary commissioners, who shall file the same with the clerk of the chancery court. Upon the filing of the report of said engineer, the chancery court, or the chancellor in vacation, shall enter an order directing the clerk of the chancery court to give notice by publication for two weeks by two insertions in some newspaper published and having a general circulation in the county or counties in which the lands of the proposed district lie, calling upon all persons owning property within said district to appear before the chancery court, or chancellor in vacation, on the date and at the time and place fixed by said order, which date shall not be earlier than twenty days and not later than forty days after the first publication, to show cause in favor of or against the establishment of the district.
     </p>
     <p>
      At the time named in said notice, the court or chancellor in vacation shall hear all property owners within the proposed drainage district who wish to appear and advocate or resist the establishment of the said district. Any petition of proponents or objectors, advocating or resisting the establishment of said district, shall be filed with the clerk of said court prior to the time designated for said hearing. If the court or chancellor in vacation deems it to the best interest of the owners of the real property within the said district that same shall become a drainage district under the terms of this chapter, he shall make an order establishing same as a drainage district, subject to all the terms and provisions of this chapter. Upon the organization of said drainage district, it shall, in its corporate name by its commissioners, henceforth have power to contract and be contracted with, to sue and be sued, to plead and be impleaded, and to do and perform in the name of such district all such acts and things for the accomplishment of the purpose for which it was organized.

     <p>
      If upon the hearing provided for in Sections 51-29-5 through 51-29-9 a petition is presented to the chancery court, or the chancellor in vacation, signed by a majority of the landholders owning one third of the land, or by one third of the landholders owning a majority of the land, praying that the improvements be made, it shall be the duty of the court or chancellor to make the order establishing the district without further inquiry, if it appear that the establishment thereof be necessary for the promotion of public health and for agricultural purposes. However, if upon that day a petition signed by a majority of the landowners owning one third of the land, or by one third of the landowners owning a majority of the land, be presented praying that the improvements be not made, it shall be the duty of the court or chancellor to so order; but if no such petition is filed, it shall be the duty of the court or chancellor to investigate as provided in the aforesaid sections and to establish such drainage districts as he is of the opinion the establishment thereof will be to the advantage of the owners of real property therein, and is for the public benefit. The petition provided for therein may be signed by women, whether married or single, owning land in the proposed district; guardians may sign for their wards; and trustees, executors, and administrators may sign for the estates represented by them; and if the signature of any corporation thereto is attested by the corporate seal, the same shall be sufficient evidence of the assent of the corporation to said petition.

      When the chancery court or chancellor in vacation has established such district, he shall appoint three (3) owners of real property within the district to act as commissioners; and such persons, when so appointed, and their successors in office shall constitute, and are hereby declared to be, a body politic and corporate by the name and style selected as mentioned in this chapter, by the court or chancellor. Each of these commissioners shall take the oath of office as required by Section 268, Article 14 of the Constitution of the state, and shall also swear that he will not, directly or indirectly, be interested in any contract made by the board of commissioners save and except insofar as he may be benefited as a landowner, in common with other landowners, by the work contracted for, and that he will well and truly assess all benefits resulting from said improvements, and all damages caused thereby. Any commissioner failing to take oath within thirty (30) days after his appointment and to give bond in the sum of not less than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), to be fixed by the court or chancellor, shall be deemed to have declined to act as commissioner, and his place shall be filled by the court or chancellor. Provided, however, where revenue for a drainage district is less than one thousand dollars ($ 1,000.00) per year from taxes or other sources, the chancellor, in his discretion, may reduce the bond to any amount he may deem sufficient.

     <p>
      All vacancies on the board shall be filled by the chancery court, or the chancellor in vacation, of the county; but, if a majority in number of the owners of real property in the district shall petition for the appointment of particular persons as commissioners, it shall be the duty of the court or chancellor to appoint the persons so designated. In the same manner, the commissioners shall be appointed at the expiration of the term of said commissioners. A majority of the commissioners shall constitute a quorum. The chancery court, or chancellor in vacation, shall remove any member of the board of commissioners, on the petition of the majority of the owners of land in the district, who shall own a majority of the acreage therein.

     <p>
      The said commissioners may adopt a common seal of the drainage district and alter the same at pleasure. They may, from time to time, make such bylaws, rules, and regulations, and alter and change the same as they may deem proper, not inconsistent with this chapter and the laws of this state, for the purpose of carrying into effect the object of their incorporation. They shall elect a president from their own number and appoint such other officers, agents, and attorneys, and employ such persons as they may think necessary for the efficient management of their business, and remove them at pleasure. They may do all acts and things not inconsistent with this chapter and with the laws of the state, and proper to effect the purpose and objects of this chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon their qualification, the board of commissioners shall prepare plans for the improvement within the district, as prayed for in the petition, and shall procure estimates from a competent engineer or engineers as to the cost thereof. For that purpose, the board of commissioners may employ such engineers and other agents as may be needful, such engineer to give bond in the sum of at least one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), payable to the drainage district and conditioned for the faithful performance of the duties required of the engineer, which bond shall be approved by the board of commissioners, or the president. Said board of commissioners may employ the services of an attorney or a firm of attorneys as may be needed in the prosecution of the work for which the drainage district is organized, may employ such other agents as may be needed, may purchase such material and supplies, and pay for such publications and printing necessary or incidental in the prosecution of the work. Said board of commissioners shall provide for reasonable compensation to the engineer or engineers, attorneys, and other agents, and for the cost of such material, supplies, publications, and printing, and the same shall be taken as a part of the costs of the improvements; or said board of commissioners may borrow money necessary to pay for the services of the engineer or engineers, attorneys, and other agents, and for the cost of such material, supplies, publications, and printing, at a rate of interest not exceeding six per cent, per annum, and may execute a note or notes or other evidences of indebtedness therefor and may renew the same as may be necessary, and the money borrowed for such purposes shall be taken as a part of the costs of the improvements.

       A drainage district with local commissioners is a subdivision of the state government with limited jurisdiction and powers and it has only such powers as are expressly granted to it by the statute or as may be necessarily implied from such legislation.

       Before contract can be made by drainage district to repair its system, and before bonds should be authorized, there must be plans and specifications to define and delineate the work to be done and to demonstrate that the proposed bond issue is adequate.

       In proceeding to authorize drainage district to borrow money to repair its system, it was error to strike so-called plans and specifications prepared for commission by their engineer, styled by him as a preliminary report, but not reversible error, as it could not be treated as substitute for plans and specifications contemplated by law and required by correct business usage.

      If for any cause the improvements shall not be made, said costs shall be charged on the real property in the district, including railroads, if any, and shall be raised and paid by assessments in the manner hereinafter described; or, in the event said assessments are not made, or the improvements shall not be completed or the same be abandoned, for any cause, after such indebtedness is incurred, the board of supervisors of the county in which the drainage district is located shall levy an acreage tax, or an ad valorem tax, on the lands in said proposed district if the same has not been organized, or on the lands of the district if the same has been organized, the total collections from which shall be sufficient to pay such indebtedness. The board of supervisors may levy a sufficient tax in one year or may levy a succession of acreage taxes, or ad valorem taxes, over a period of years, not to exceed three years, to be determined by said board of supervisors. If an ad valorem tax be levied, the board of supervisors may use for that purpose the assessments of the land of the last assessment roll of the county in which said lands are situated. In case the lands in the proposed district lie in more than one county, then the chancellor aforesaid shall apportion said indebtedness between the several counties, and the boards of supervisors of the several counties shall thereupon levy such apportioned tax upon the lands of their counties respectively, according to the ruling of the said chancellor.

       An additional assessment may be made without regard to the present existence of actual and additional material benefits to a particular integrated tract, when it appears “absolutely necessary in order to preserve and maintain the improvements of the district,” and the mere fact that landowner was not apparently benefited from the improvement and maintenance of a certain drainage canal in the district because of his location on high land does not excuse him from bearing his just proportion of the costs of removing obstructions and silt from such lower canal in the district.

    Preparation of assessment roll.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Said commissioners shall proceed to assess the land within the district and shall inscribe in a book the description of each tract of land, the benefit to accrue to each tract by reason of such improvement, and shall enter such assessments of benefits opposite the description, together with an estimate of what the landowner will probably have to pay on such assessment for the first year. The assessment shall embrace not merely the land, but all railroad and other improvements on lands which will be benefited by the drainage system. In preparing the description of the lands so assessed, the commissioners may use either (1) the descriptions of lands and subdivisions thereof as shown on the official United States Government surveys and plats of lands within the district; (2) the descriptions of lands and subdivisions thereof as shown upon any plat of lands within the district and recorded upon the land records of the county in which said lands are located; (3) any metes and bounds descriptions found in the latest filed conveyance of said lands and of record in the records of deeds of the county in which said lands are located, and in such case it shall be sufficient to describe said lands by stating the number of acres and the general location of the land within the section, together with the book and page numbers of said conveyance. They shall place opposite each tract of land the name of the supposed owner, as shown by the last county land assessment roll; but a mistake in the name shall not vitiate the assessment. If any landowner or private corporation or any other drainage district has dug ditches or made drainage work that can be profitably used as a part of the general proposed system, the value of such ditches or drainage work to the district shall be assessed by said commissioners and shall appear upon the assessment and be paid for by the district, either in cash or by reduction of assessment. The commissioners shall also assess and place upon said roll or book of assessment, opposite each tract of land, all damages that will accrue to any landowner by reason of the proposed improvement, including all injury to lands taken or damaged; and when said commissioners return no assessment of damages as to any tract of land, it shall be deemed a finding by them that no damages will be sustained. If the commissioners, at any time either before or after the organization of the district, find that other land not embraced within the boundaries of the district will be benefited by the proposed improvement or improvements already made, they shall assess the estimated benefit to such lands and shall specially report to the chancery court, or chancellor in vacation, the assessments which they have made on land beyond the boundaries of the district, as already established. It shall thereupon be the duty of the clerk of the chancery court to give notice by two (2) weekly insertions in a newspaper published in the county where such lands lie describing the additional lands which have been assessed; and the owners of real property so assessed shall be allowed not less than ten (10) days after the last publication of such notice in which to file with the clerk of the chancery court their protest against being so assessed, or included within the district. The chancery court, or chancellor in vacation, shall, at its next succeeding session after the time for filing of such protest shall have expired, investigate the question whether the lands beyond the boundaries of the district so assessed by the commissioners will in fact be benefited by the making of the improvement, and from its finding in that regard, either the property owner or the commissioners of the district may, within twenty (20) days appeal to the supreme court. If the finding is in favor of the commissioners, the limits of the district shall be extended so as to embrace any lands that may be benefited by the making of the improvement. When their assessment is completed, the commissioners shall subscribe such assessment and deposit it with the clerk of the chancery court where it shall be kept and preserved as a public record; provided that, for the purpose of providing funds with which to clean out, restore, repair and rehabilitate the whole or any part of the drainage system of such district or for the purpose of cooperating with the United States or any agency thereof in such works, there may be imposed a uniform assessment on each acre of unsubdivided land lying within the district, and a uniform assessment by lot on subdivided land lying within the district, and the records required in this chapter shall show the amount of the assessment in lieu of the amount of benefits to accrue to each tract. Taxes levied hereunder are hereby declared to be taxes for maintenance purposes and shall not diminish in any manner the amount of assessed benefits in any such district which is otherwise available for the payment of any outstanding bonds of such district.
     </p>
     <p>
      The assessments provided for in this section may be made even though evidences of indebtedness have been issued or validated or both prior thereto, but the lien of the holders of any such indebtedness shall not be impaired thereby.

       An additional assessment may be made without regard to the present existence of actual and additional material benefits to a particular integrated tract, when it appears “absolutely necessary in order to preserve and maintain the improvements of the district,” and the mere fact that landowner was not apparently benefited from the improvement and maintenance of a certain drainage canal in the district because of his location on high land does not excuse him from bearing his just proportion of the costs of removing obstructions and silt from such lower canal in the district. Buchanan v. Red Banks Creek Drainage Dist., 205 Miss. 736, 39 So. 2d 321, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 463 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>

       Petition of drainage district commissioners for authority to borrow money to repair drainage system which did not include adjacent landowners who used canals and benefited therefrom was defective since all interested persons were not made parties.

      </p>
      <p>
       Neither commissioners of drainage district personally, nor the sureties on their official bonds, were liable to holders of unpaid bonds of first series issued by the district for paying bonds of the second series which were invalid because additional benefits had not been assessed against the land as a basis for the issuance of the second bonds, where the commissioners acted ministerially in good faith, since the acts of the commissioners were chargeable to the board in its official capacity rather than to the members individually; Moreover, they were not liable on the theory that the funds of the district constituted trust funds exclusively for the payment of the bonds of the first issue. People's Bank Liquidating Corp. v. Beashea Drainage Dist., 199 Miss. 505, 24 So. 2d 784, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 220 (Miss. 1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       Drainage district commissioners had right to assess additional benefits against the land in the district for further improvements after full expenditure of the proceeds from the first bond issue, if in their judgment further benefits would accrue to the landowners by virtue of such further construction, or if in their judgment it had become necessary to preserve the improvements theretofore made.

       Value which drainage commissioners place on benefits accruing to land in district from drainage improvements is for their determination, subject to review by court. Anderson v. Robins, 161 Miss. 604, 137 So. 476, 1931 Miss. LEXIS 281 (Miss. 1931).

       Benefits resulting to land within drainage district from expenditures made to preserve and maintain improvements must be proportionately assessed against all lands of district without reference to any inequality that might have existed in original assessment.

      Any property owner may accept the assessment of damages in his favor made by the commissioners, or acquiesce in their failure to assess damages in his favor, and shall be construed to have done so unless he gives to said commissioners, within thirty days after the assessment is filed, notice in writing that he demands assessment of his damages by jury. In such event the commissioners shall institute in the proper court in the proper county an action to condemn the lands that must be taken or damaged in making such improvements, which action shall be in accordance with the proceeding for the condemnation of property for public use provided in the chapter on eminent domain. Where condemnation proceedings are had as herein provided and an appeal is taken to the circuit court, the drainage commissioners may pay the amount awarded by the jury into the hands of the clerk of the circuit court, who shall hold the same to abide the decision of said appeal, and the drainage commissioners may proceed with the work of constructing the drain as laid out by them.

       A drainage district has no express power or implied power to buy an undivided interest of land except for drainage purposes. Eden Drainage Dist. v. Swaim, 212 Miss. 386, 54 So. 2d 547, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 461 (Miss. 1951).

      <p>
       A drainage district with local commissioners is a subdivision of the state government with limited jurisdiction and powers and it has only such powers as are expressly granted to it by the statute or as may be necessarily implied from such legislation.

       § 51-29-39.
    Appraisement by commissioners as alternate method to acquire land and damage compensation.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In lieu of the method provided in Sections 51-29-29 through 51-29-35 for acquiring land and making compensation for damages, the drainage commissioners may adopt the following method for acquiring lands and making compensation for damages, to wit:
     </p>
     <p>
      The commissioners may, at any time after the organization of the district, appraise the value of any land taken or to be taken for the purposes of the proposed improvement, according to the plans of the district on file, and the damages resulting to the owners from such taking. The board may specify, in case of any property, the particular purpose for which and the extent to which easement is desired, and the assessment of property in such case shall represent only the damages resulting from the use so specified. They may make a complete appraisement of all such lands, taken or to be taken, at one time, or at any time make appraisements as it becomes necessary or desirable. When the commissioners have made their appraisement of lands taken, they shall certify to the same and file it with the clerk of the chancery court of the county in which the land lies. The court, or chancellor in vacation, shall enter an order designating the date, time, and place for the hearing of objections to such appraisement, either at a regular term of the court or in vacation. The clerk shall issue a summons directed to the sheriff of the county or counties of the state in which any landowner or other person interested may reside, commanding him to summon such owner or owners or interested persons to appear at the time and place named. If the owner of any land sought to be taken is an infant or person of unsound mind, the summons may be served on his guardian; and the guardian in such cases is authorized, subject to the approval of the chancellor in termtime or vacation, to sell and convey such property and dedicate it thus to the public use, or he may agree upon the damages and thereby bind the ward. If there is no guardian in such case, the chancellor in vacation may, on application of anyone in interest, appoint a guardian ad litem to represent such infant or person of unsound mind, whose acts and doings in the premises shall be valid and binding on the ward. The chancellor may require a bond of such guardian ad litem. The clerk of the court shall notify the guardian ad litem of his appointment and the amount of bond required, if any, by certified mail sent to the post office address of the guardian. If the owner of such land is a nonresident of the state or cannot be found, or if the owner is unknown, and this shall apply to any person interested, upon affidavit to that fact being made by the commissioners or by their agent or attorney, service of the summons may be delivered to any of his agents in charge of the land; or publication shall be made in the manner provided by law for publication for nonresident and unknown parties in chancery suits. If the land belongs to a deceased person whose estate is being administered, the summons may be served upon the executor or administrator, who shall, for all purposes of this chapter, be authorized to act for the owner, and shall be responsible on his bond accordingly. Such notice, when published, need only state that the hearing will be for the purpose of confirming the report of the commissioners as to the appraisement of land taken for the use of the district. The notice shall contain the names of the owners or persons interested in such land and their post office address, if known, and if unknown, that fact shall be so stated, and shall contain a list of the land, described by section numbers, belonging to such nonresident owners through which the ditches of the district are to run, or which such lands are to be taken for the uses of the district.
     </p>
     <p>
      If any owner is not satisfied with the amount allowed by the commissioners for lands taken by reason of the construction of such proposed system according to the plans of the district, he shall file with the clerk of the court written objections, in specific terms, prior to the time designated for the hearing.
     </p>
     <p>
      If no written objections are filed, a decree confirming the appraisement shall be rendered, and upon payment of the amount to the chancery clerk, the commissioners of the district may enter upon and take possession of the property and appropriate it to the public use of the district and the title of the property shall thereupon vest in the district. The clerk shall receipt upon the decree for the money paid, and the decree with the receipt thereon shall be recorded.
     </p>
     <p>
      If written objections are filed prior to the time set for the hearing, the court or chancellor in vacation shall proceed to hear the objections filed, trying the cause or causes without the intervention of a jury.
     </p>
     <p>
      No judgment by default shall be entered against an owner or person interested residing in this state unless it appears that he has been duly served with summons at least thirty (30) days before the return day, and no judgment by default shall be rendered against any nonresident or unknown person or persons interested unless proper publication has been made.

       This section is unconstitutional on its face regarding the very narrow due process issue of adequate notice to prepare for trial, since two days from the date of service of process is inadequate time to hire an appraiser and prepare for a trial on the issue of just compensation.

    Court to make order for assessments to cover cost of improvement.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The chancery court or chancellor in vacation shall, at the same time that the assessment of benefits is filed or at any subsequent time when called upon by the board of commissioners of the district so to do, enter upon the minutes of the chancery court an order which shall have all the force of a judgment, providing that there shall be assessed upon the real property of the district a special assessment or levy to pay the estimated cost of the improvement, with not less than ten per cent added for unforeseen contingencies. The amount to be assessed upon each tract of land included within the district shall be such part of the estimated cost of the improvement as the assessment of benefits against such tract bears to the assessment of benefits against all the real property in the district. Said assessments are to be paid in annual installments, not to exceed ten per cent in any one year, as provided in such order; but if any landowner elects, he may pay the whole amount of the assessment against his land before it becomes due or at any time thereafter, or all or any part of said assessment at any time he sees fit, provided such payment is made before any bonds are issued by the district.
     </p>
     <p>
      The assessment or assessments so levied shall be a lien on all of the real property of the district from the time that the same is levied by the chancery court or chancellor in vacation in an amount not to exceed the total amount of estimated benefits on all the real property in the district, shall be entitled to preference to all demands, executions, encumbrances, or liens whatsoever, and shall continue until such assessment, with any penalty and costs that may accrue thereon, shall have been paid. The remedy against such assessment shall be by appeal to the supreme court, and such appeal must be taken within twenty days from the time that said assessment has been made by the chancery court, or chancellor in vacation. On such appeal the presumption shall be in favor of the legality of the assessment.

     <p>
      After the assessment of benefits or betterments and damages and the levy of assessments to be paid shall have been made and become final in the manner hereinbefore provided, and for the purpose of facilitating the collection of the assessments so levied, it shall be the duty of the board of commissioners to prepare, or cause to be prepared, a copy or copies of the assessment roll in which they shall inscribe the names of the landowners, the description of the tracts of land assessed, the total betterment assessed against each tract, and the total damages assessed against each tract, and the amount of the levy for the current year, which shall be the amount of tax to be collected for that year by the tax collector. The commissioners may at any time also employ some competent person to calculate the amount of tax to be paid each year for each tract of land in the district, and extend the same on the rolls of the district. Such copy of the roll shall be certified to by the commissioner and be deposited with the clerk of the board of supervisors of the judicial district of the county in which the land lies, and if a drainage district embraces lands lying in more than one county or judicial district, a copy of said roll shall be filed with the clerk of the board of supervisors in each district or county. It shall be the duty of the clerk to transmit said roll or rolls to the said tax collector of such county or counties on or before the first day of October of the year in which the tax levy is to be collected, and said roll shall constitute the authority and be the guide for the collection of said drainage tax by the collector. If any collector shall wilfully neglect, fail, or refuse to collect any tax shown on said roll to have been levied in the manner herein provided, he shall be liable on his bond as county tax collector for any taxes lost to the drainage district, together with damages thereon at the rate of thirty per cent.
     </p>
     <p>
      For any failure to pay over any tax so collected at the same time he is required by law to pay over state and county taxes, said tax collector shall be liable for damages at the rate of thirty per cent and interest at the rate of six per cent per annum on the principal and damages.

    Duties of treasurer.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The treasurer of each county may be the treasurer of all drainage districts organized under this chapter in their respective counties and, as such treasurer, shall receive from the county tax collector, whose duty it shall be to collect all moneys levied by said drainage commissioners or by the board of supervisors at their request. Where a drainage district is organized lying in more than one (1) county, the board of commissioners of any such drainage district may select the treasurer of either or any county in which a part of the district lies, who shall be the treasurer of said district; or whether the district lies in one or more counties, the board of commissioners may select their treasurer and remove him at their pleasure, whose duty shall be the same as those of the county treasurers of such district. The board of commissioners shall compel such county treasurer or treasurers selected by them to give bond to them, as commissioners of said district, in an amount equal to the amount of any sum or sums of money likely to come into said treasurer’s hand at any one (1) time, and said commissioners shall enter an order on their minutes fixing the amount of the bond of such treasurer. However, in the event that one (1) treasurer serves more than one (1) board of commissioners, in lieu of separate bonds, he may be required to give bond payable jointly to all commissioners served in an amount not to exceed three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000.00). The said board of commissioners shall, however, select a depository or depositories of the funds of the district and enter the selection on the minutes of the district. Such depository or depositories may qualify as depository of the district in like manner as required by the law on depositories, giving security as therein required, and may place with the treasurer of the district as security for such deposit any of the drainage bonds of the district for which it proposes to qualify as the depository.
     </p>
     <p>
      The treasurer shall pay out no money save upon the order of the board of commissioners, and upon a warrant signed by the president thereof. If there be no depository, he shall be allowed a commission of not exceeding one-half of one percent (1/2 of 1%) on all receipts and not exceeding one-half of one percent (1/2 of 1%) on all disbursements; he shall not be entitled to any commission on money received from the sale of bonds, or of interest bearing certificates, or of any money paid in liquidation thereof. Said county treasurer or the treasurers selected by the commissioners shall keep a separate account with each drainage district; and every warrant shall state upon its face to whom payable, the amount, and the purpose for which it was issued. All warrants shall be dated and numbered consecutively in a record to be kept by the board of commissioners of the number and amount of each; and no warrant shall be paid unless there are in the treasury funds sufficient to pay all outstanding warrants bearing a lower number. No warrant shall be increased by reason of any depreciation in the market value thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      All funds coming into the hands of the treasurer belonging to any drainage district organized under this chapter shall be deposited in the depository provided for herein, to be drawn out by the proper parties and in the manner above provided. All tax collectors may pay drainage taxes into such depositories in the same manner as county funds are paid in, and shall be subject to the same protection as is provided for the protection of general county funds.

       Bank, as de facto depository of funds of drainage district, was not liable to the holders of unpaid bonds of the first issue on ground that the bank paid some of the bonds and interest coupons of the second issue without first requiring the drainage district commissioners to enter a written order on the minutes and issue a warrant for that purpose, even though the second bond issue was invalid because additional benefits had not been assessed against the lands of the district as a basis for the issuance of that issue, where the bank had no knowledge thereof; nor was the bnak liable on a trust-fund theory where the bank had no notice that the funds were being held in trust exclusively for the payment of the bonds of the first issue.

     </h3>
     <p>
      All contractors shall be required to give a performance bond and a payment bond, which may be in one or in separate instruments, for the faithful performance of such contract as may be awarded them, with good and sufficient sureties in amounts to be fixed by the board of commissioners; and the board of commissioners shall not remit or excuse the penalty or forfeiture of said bond or bonds or the breaches thereof. The board of commissioners may appoint all necessary agents for carrying on the work and may fix their pay. They may buy all necessary material and implements as may be on hand and which may be necessary for the completion of the improvements under way, or which have been completed; and may in general, make all such contracts in the prosecution of the work as may best serve the public interest. It shall be the duty of the board of commissioners to have the amount of any work done by the contractor estimated from time to time, as may be desirable, by the engineer selected by the board of commissioners; and said board shall draw its warrants in favor of the contractor for not more than ninety per cent (90%) of the work so reported, reserving the remainder until it has been ascertained that the work has been completed according to contract, and is free from liens.

     </h3>
     <p>
      For the purpose of constructing and maintaining the ditches and other improvements provided for under this chapter, for carrying out the purposes and provisions of this chapter, and for paying for the work incident thereto, the said board of commissioners shall have power to borrow money and to issue its negotiable evidence of indebtedness or serial bonds therefor, not exceeding in amount the total amount of benefits assessed against all the real property in the district. Such bonds shall be in such sums and denominations of not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) each as the said board of commissioners may prescribe, shall each be signed by the members of the said board of commissioners and bear the seal of its drainage district, and shall be made payable, either within or without the limits of this state, to the person or persons to whom sold, or bearer, or bearer simply, at the discretion of said board. No bond issued under the terms of this chapter shall run for more than thirty (30) years; and said bonds may be made to mature serially in such numbers as the board may elect, so that a portion thereof may mature each year as the assessments are collected. Such bonds shall not bear a greater overall maximum interest rate to maturity than that allowed in Section 75-17-101, for which interest coupons may be attached, payable at such time and place as the board may contract, which interest coupons shall bear the facsimile signature of each member of the board of commissioners lithographed thereon. The said bonds may be sold or negotiated in any market in or out of the state at not less than their par value, provided, however, that the cost of lithographing or printing and the necessary expenses of selling said bonds may be incurred.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, bonds referred to hereinabove may be issued pursuant to the supplemental powers and authorizations conferred by the provisions of the registered bond act, being Sections 31-21-1 through 31-21-7.

      </h4>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 4704] does not authorize the commissioners of an existing drainage district, whose original plan of improvement has been adopted and constructed and the assessment of benefits therefor completely exhausted, to borrow money for the purpose of paying preliminary expenses incurred in connection with a proposed new program of improvements in the district which was abandoned without assessment of additional benefits. Gilmore-Puckett Lumber Co. v. Big Brown's Creek Drainage Dist., 207 Miss. 316, 42 So. 2d 226, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 342 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       In order for the special act (Local and Private Laws of 1924, chapter 607), authorizing a particular drainage district to issue additional bonds, to have constituted the proper exercise of legislative power, it should have required that the additional bonds to be issued thereunder should be in an amount, the principal and interest of which, together with the principal and interest of the outstanding bonds, should not exceed the sum of the benefits theretofore assessed, or to be assessed, against the lands. People's Bank Liquidating Corp. v. Beashea Drainage Dist., 199 Miss. 505, 24 So. 2d 784, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 220 (Miss. 1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       Code 1942, § 4353 imposing liability upon drainage district commissioners on their official bonds to holders of bonds or coupons issued by the district, does not provide for liability of the commissioners on account of their failure to assess sufficient benefits for the payment of all bonds and coupons of two series, or because they caused part of the taxes against the benefits assessed to be paid to the holders of the bonds of the second series without first issuing a warrant in that behalf, especially where the bond and coupons so paid would have been paid on an equal basis with those of the first series if sufficient benefits had been assessed. People's Bank Liquidating Corp. v. Beashea Drainage Dist., 199 Miss. 505, 24 So. 2d 784, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 220 (Miss. 1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither commissioners of drainage district personally, nor the sureties on their official bonds, were liable to holders of unpaid bonds of first series issued by the district for paying bonds of the second series which were invalid because additional benefits had not been assessed against the land as a basis for the issuance of the second bond, where the commissioners acted ministerially in good faith, since the acts of the commissioners were chargeable to the board in its official capacity rather than to the members individually; Moreover, they were not liable on the theory that the funds of the district constituted trust funds exclusively for the payment of the bonds of the first issue. People's Bank Liquidating Corp. v. Beashea Drainage Dist., 199 Miss. 505, 24 So. 2d 784, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 220 (Miss. 1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       Drainage district commissioners had right to assess additional benefits against the land in the district for further improvements after full expenditure of the proceeds from the first bond issue, if in their judgment further benefits would accrue to the landowners by virtue of such further construction, or if in their judgment it had become necessary to preserve the improvements theretofore made. People's Bank Liquidating Corp. v. Beashea Drainage Dist., 199 Miss. 505, 24 So. 2d 784, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 220 (Miss. 1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no personal liability on the part of property owners for the payment of drainage district bonds. People's Bank Liquidating Corp. v. Beashea Drainage Dist., 199 Miss. 505, 24 So. 2d 784, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 220 (Miss. 1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       Legislature may authorize drainage district to contract debts prior to or subsequent to assessment of benefits, provided liability imposed is not in excess of benefits accruing to land. Anderson v. McKee, 182 Miss. 156, 179 So. 858, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 136 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where supplemental bonds were found necessary, new assessment of benefits could be made if commissioners believed land would receive additional benefits to those already assessed. Anderson v. McKee, 182 Miss. 156, 179 So. 858, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 136 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       Commissioners could be compelled by mandamus to meet and consider whether levy of additional benefits justified, but judgment as to whether additional benefits had, or would accrue could not be controlled. Anderson v. McKee, 182 Miss. 156, 179 So. 858, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 136 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where original and additional bond issues exceeded assessment of benefits and district was extended to other lands already benefited by improvements, new assessments could be made on all lands of district as extended. Anderson v. McKee, 182 Miss. 156, 179 So. 858, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 136 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where original and additional bonds exceeded assessment of benefits, it was duty of commissioners and supervisors to make new assessment, and levy tax to pay bonds, if it appears new assessment is justified. Anderson v. McKee, 182 Miss. 156, 179 So. 858, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 136 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       Bondholders could not compel new assessment and tax levy, but could only compel commissioners to meet and exercise discretion as to whether justified. Anderson v. McKee, 182 Miss. 156, 179 So. 858, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 136 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       Incurring of obligations are to be determined not by electors but by the landowners. Huston v. Mayo, 120 Miss. 523, 82 So. 334, 1919 Miss. LEXIS 115 (Miss. 1919).
      </p>
      <p>
       Money to be collected from landowners is a local assessment and not a tax, and may be collected without submission of bond issue. Huston v. Mayo, 120 Miss. 523, 82 So. 334, 1919 Miss. LEXIS 115 (Miss. 1919).

    Procedure to alter plans.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The commissioners may at any time alter the plans of ditches and drains, but before constructing the ditches according to the changed plans, the changed plans with accompanying specifications, showing the width and depth of the ditches as changed, shall be filed with the clerk of the chancery court, or chancellor in vacation, and notice of such filing shall be given by publication for two insertions in some newspaper issued and having a bona fide circulation in each of the counties in which there are lands belonging to the district. If by reason of such change of plans any property owner deems that the assessment has become inequitable, he may petition the chancery court, or chancellor in vacation, which shall thereupon refer his petition to the board of commissioners of the district, who shall reassess his property, increasing or diminishing his assessment as they may find just. From such action of the commissioners the property owner shall have the same right of appeal to the board of supervisors that is herein provided for in cases of original assessment. However, in no case after the issuance of bonds, shall the assessment be lowered either by the board of commissioners or the chancery court, or chancellor in vacation, so as to endanger the security of said bonds. Any reduction in benefits may be allowed as damages, and the allowances for such damage shall be secondary and subordinate to the rights of holders of bonds or evidences of indebtedness issued theretofore. No change of plans as above authorized shall be made so as to lower the standard of efficiency of the proposed system of improvement, nor so as to jeopardize the rights of any holder or holders of bonds previously issued; and this question may be raised by any landholder before the chancery court, or chancellor in vacation, with rights of appeal as herein provided.

     <p>
      No corporation, individual, or other drainage district, outside the limits of any district organized or operating under the terms of this chapter, shall drain into any ditch belonging to any district formed or operating under the terms of this chapter, without first paying compensation, to be ascertained by a jury in the circuit court or chancery court, for the use of said ditch, unless an agreement is reached between the commissioners of the district and the corporation, individual, or other drainage district desiring to use such ditch, as to such compensation. This and Section 51-29-77 shall not operate to interfere with vested rights to natural drainage.

      In case it is necessary to do so in order to obtain a proper outlet for the drainage system, the commissioners may construct ditches or do other work beyond the border of their district so as to carry the water to some proper outlet or otherwise to secure the object of the improvement. In that event, they shall have the right to condemn a right of way for such drain or other construction, and the proceedings thereof shall be the same that are now provided by law. Such a ditch or drain beyond the limits of the district shall be the property of the district, and no person not assessed shall have the right to dig any lateral drain connecting therewith without the consent of the commissioners. If such property owner cannot agree with the commissioners as to the price to be paid for the privilege of connecting with such ditch, the board of supervisors of the county where such connection is sought to be made shall fix the amount of such compensation, and either shall have the right to appeal from its findings to the circuit court.

      The drainage district shall not cease to exist upon the completion of its drainage system, but shall continue to exist as a body corporate for the purpose of preserving the system of drainage, keeping the ditch clear from obstruction, extending, widening, or deepening the ditches from time to time, and for doing such other things and acts in order to carry out the purposes of this chapter and of the drainage system so established, as may be found advantageous to the district. For those purposes, the board of commissioners may borrow money and issue its bonds in such sums and in the manner provided in this chapter, and may from time to time apply to the chancery court, or chancellor in vacation, for the levying of additional assessments upon the benefits for the payment of said work or said bonds. Upon the filing of such application or petition with the clerk of the chancery court, he shall give notice by publication by two insertions in a newspaper published in each of the counties in which the district embraces land. Any property owner seeking to resist such additional levy may appear at the next term of the chancery court, or the chancellor in vacation, not less than ten days after the last insertion of said notice and urge his objections to such levy. In case he fails to appear, such levy shall stand with the force of a final judgment, but either the property owners or the commissioners may appeal to the supreme court not later than twenty days after the date of such levy.

       This section [Code 1942, § 4713] does not authorize commissioners of an existing drainage district, whose original plan of improvement has been adopted and constructed, and the assessment of benefits therefor completely exhausted, to borrow money or levy a tax for the purpose of paying preliminary expenses incurred in connection with a proposed new plan of improvements in the district which was abandoned without assessment of additional benefits. Gilmore-Puckett Lumber Co. v. Big Brown's Creek Drainage Dist., 207 Miss. 316, 42 So. 2d 226, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 342 (Miss. 1949).

      <p>
       In proceeding to authorize drainage district to borrow money to repair its system, final decree providing that no bonds be issued until contract to perform new work shall be executed according to law will be relaxed by supreme court to provide that commissioners may, in their discretion, negotiate contract, if possible, after filing and receiving approval of further plans and specifications, and submit same to chancellor, to be approved or disapproved by him, subject to ability to sell the bonds, or if such contract is impossible to secure, on proof of competent evidence of that fact, chancellor make such other provision, in his discretion as will overcome such obstacle, within purview of the law. Moorhead Drainage Dist. v. Jackson, 208 Miss. 594, 45 So. 2d 234, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 277 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       In proceeding by drainage district for authority to borrow money for maintenance of drainage system, chancellor has no authority after final judgment establishing it, to release lands from district, but where lands will not be benefited by rehabilitation of drainage system because they involve abandoned drainage ditch which never functioned, such lands should be released from new assessment and levy and commissioners released from clearing out and maintaining abandoned ditch, and chancellor’s release of land from district may be construed as so holding. Moorhead Drainage Dist. v. Jackson, 208 Miss. 594, 45 So. 2d 234, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 277 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       When chancellor rules in favor of drainage district by overruling objections of landowners to borrowing of money to repair drainage system under this section [Code 1942, § 4713] it cannot be said that he was in error in hearing proof on questions raised by objections. Moorhead Drainage Dist. v. Jackson, 208 Miss. 594, 45 So. 2d 234, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 277 (Miss. 1950).

      </h4>
      <p>
       Issue of whether landowner’s objections to petition for additional maintenance assessment under this section [Code 1942, § 4713] was filed within proper time becomes moot when chancellor overrules objections, after hearing evidence on both sides, and protestants take no cross-appeal from his ruling. Moorhead Drainage Dist. v. Jackson, 208 Miss. 594, 45 So. 2d 234, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 277 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       Additional lands brought within drainage district, without objection, are subject to such assessment of benefits, after having been brought into district, as are right and proper. Moorhead Drainage Dist. v. Jackson, 208 Miss. 594, 45 So. 2d 234, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 277 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       An additional assessment may be made without regard to the present existence of actual and additional material benefits to a particular integrated tract, when it appears “absolutely necessary in order to preserve and maintain the improvements of the district,” and the mere fact that landowner was not apparently benefited from the improvement and maintenance of a certain drainage canal in the district because of his location on high land does not excuse him from bearing his just proportion of the costs of removing obstructions and silt from such lower canal in the district. Buchanan v. Red Banks Creek Drainage Dist., 205 Miss. 736, 39 So. 2d 321, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 463 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>

       Subsequent assessment by drainage district must be based on benefits accruing and made against property of entire district. Dick v. Atchafalaya Drainage & Levee Dist., 147 Miss. 783, 113 So. 897, 1927 Miss. LEXIS 359 (Miss. 1927).

     </h3>
     <p>
      All taxes levied under the terms of this chapter shall be payable at the same time the state and county taxes are payable. The tax collector shall place the same upon the tax receipt along with the state and county and other taxes, shall collect all of the taxes due on said land together, and shall not accept payment of any sum less than the entire aggregate amount of all state, county, drainage, and other taxes due upon said lands. Should said taxes, including the drainage taxes, be not paid at maturity, the tax collector shall sell said lands for all taxes due thereon, including drainage taxes, at the time and in the manner now provided for the sale of land for taxes due thereon to the state and county. Such sale shall be subject to the provisions of law for the sale of land for state and county taxes, and the owner of said land shall have the right to redeem from said sale as now provided by law.
     </p>
     <p>
      When any lands situated in a drainage district are sold for nonpayment of taxes thereon, the drainage district in which same is situated may, in the discretion of its board of commissioners, appear at said sale and purchase said land in the name of the drainage district in the same manner as an individual, and in that event shall pay to the tax collector the amount of said purchase price out of the funds of the district.
     </p>
     <p>
      If upon offering the land of any delinquent taxpayer constituting one tract, no person will bid for it the whole amount of taxes and all costs, the collector shall strike same off to the state in the same manner as provided for in case of sales for state and county taxes.
     </p>
     <p>
      When any land shall be sold to the state for taxes due thereon and the same shall not be redeemed within the time provided by law, the same may be sold or contracted for sale by the land commissioner, in the manner provided for the sale and contract for sale of other tax forfeited lands.
     </p>
     <p>
      Except as herein otherwise provided, the provisions of the law relative to the sale of delinquent land for taxes, the title thereto, and the handling and sale of lands sold to the state for taxes shall apply to all sales under this chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      When any drainage district shall have purchased lands at any tax sale under the terms of this chapter, the board of commissioners thereof, after the period of redemption has expired, may sell, lease, or rent the lands so purchased. The deed or lease shall be executed by the president and secretary of the board of commissioners under the seal of the district. But said lands shall not be sold for an amount less than the price paid therefor and all subsequently accrued state, county, drainage, and other taxes. However, the drainage commissioners with the consent of the bondholders may sell the lands of the drainage district for an amount less than the price paid therefor and all subsequently accrued state, county, drainage, and other taxes.
     </p>
     <p>
      The drainage district shall pay all state and county and other taxes assessed against said land purchased by it at tax sales under the provisions of this chapter, and may pay the same out of any funds belonging to the district.
     </p>
     <p>
      The chancery clerks of the counties in which are located drainage districts, or parts thereof, shall account to the commissioners of such drainage districts for money received in the redemption of lands sold for taxes belonging to such districts, in the same manner as for state and county taxes. Any lands sold for any drainage taxes may be redeemed in the same manner and within the same time as provided by law for the redemption of lands sold for state and county taxes upon the payment of all costs, five per centum damages on the amount of taxes for which the land was sold, and interest on all such taxes at the rate of one per centum per month or any fractional part thereof, from the date of such sale.
     </p>
     <p>
      Lands purchased by the board of drainage commissioners of any drainage district at a tax sale and lands purchased by the board of drainage commissioners of any drainage district from the state shall be liable thereafter for state and county taxes levied and assessed against the same to the same extent as if owned by a natural person or a private corporation. And it shall be the duty of the tax assessor to assess said lands for taxes in the same manner as other lands are assessed; and if the taxes are not paid when due, such lands shall be sold by the tax collector for the delinquent taxes due and unpaid at the time and in the manner provided by law.

       A drainage district with local commissioners is a subdivision of the state government with limited jurisdiction and powers and it has only such powers as are expressly granted to it by the statute or as may be necessarily implied from such legislation. Eden Drainage Dist. v. Swaim, 212 Miss. 386, 54 So. 2d 547, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 461 (Miss. 1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 4714] and other sections (Code 1942, §§ 4090, 4651, 4695), declaring that the lien on the land for the collection of the assessed benefits shall not be abated, are all designed for the protection of the drainage district and to prevent an impairment of its contract with the bondholders who may have supplied the funds for the draining and improvement of the lands against which the lien attaches. Willis Creek Drainage Dist. v. Yazoo County, 209 Miss. 849, 48 So. 2d 498, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 449 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       Drainage assessments and taxes create no personal liability against the landowner since they are charges against the land only. Waits v. Black Bayou Drainage Dist., 186 Miss. 270, 185 So. 577, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 197 (Miss. 1939).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 4714] provides the exclusive remedy for the collection of plaintiff’s taxes, so that neither the circuit court nor the chancery court has jurisdiction of an action by a drainage district to recover drainage taxes assessed against land in the district. Waits v. Black Bayou Drainage Dist., 186 Miss. 270, 185 So. 577, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 197 (Miss. 1939).
      </p>

      The commissioners of the district shall have the right and power to carry the ditches, either main or lateral, across any highway; and the board of supervisors shall construct suitable bridges across such ditches.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such ditches may also be carried under or through any railroad track or tramway, and in such event the commissioners of the drainage district shall notify the railroad company or owner of said tramway or telegraph or telephone companies, operating lines of telegraph or telephone under or through which it is proposed to carry such ditches, of the probable time at which the contractor will be ready to enter upon the right of way of any of said companies and construct the work thereon. It shall thereupon be the duty of any said companies or owners of said lines of railway, telegraph, or telephone to send a representative to view the ground with the superintendent of construction, or other person appointed by the commissioners, and arrange the exact time at which the said work can be most conveniently done. At the time agreed upon, said railroads or owners thereof shall remove all rails, ties, stringers, and such other obstructions as may be necessary, and such owners of telegraph and telephone lines shall remove all wires, poles, and other obstructions as may be necessary, to permit the excavation of a channel or channels through its right of way. The work so done shall be planned and conducted so as to interfere in the least possible manner with the business of said railroad, telegraph, and telephone companies. In case any of such persons or corporations refuse and fail to remove any of said obstructions and to allow the construction of the work through its right of way, it shall be held as delaying the construction of a public work and improvement, and shall be liable to a penalty not to exceed fifty dollars ($50.00) per day for each day of delay thereof and all damages sustained by the district or contractor, to be recovered in any court having jurisdiction. Such penalty shall inure to the drainage district, and such damages shall inure to the person, firm, or district damaged. An itemized bill of the expenses of the railroad company for opening its track shall be made and presented to the commissioners of the district at some day previous to the day set for passing through said right of way, and a like itemized bill of expense attending the removal of wires and poles of telegraph and telephone companies shall be so presented, including all damages that will be sustained by any of said companies by the construction of said work. Thereupon the board of commissioners shall allow and pay such part thereof as it sees fit and proper, from which allowance either of said companies shall have the right of appeal to the chancery court, or chancellor in vacation; but such appeal shall not operate so as to prevent the drainage commissioners from constructing the proposed work through the rights of way of any of said companies.

Before any such change may be made, the clerk of the board of drainage commissioners shall give notice that such action is sought to be taken, which notice shall be published in a weekly newspaper published in the county in which such land is situated for three weeks preceding the meeting at which such action is to be taken. This notice shall state that it is proposed that such board will apportion the assessment of benefits as set up on the assessment rolls of the named drainage district on the date to be named at the place to be named, and shall carry a description of the lands to be affected as well as the name of the owner thereof as set up on said assessment roll. Such notice by publication, as provided herein, shall also be directed to all bondholders or persons interested in said drainage district or the lands embraced therein, and shall specifically give the date and place of said meeting. Upon the hearing of said matter before such drainage commissioners and all objections thereto, any party, person, firm, corporation, bondholder, other landowners within the drainage district, or persons in any wise interested or affected by the decision of such drainage commissioners in apportioning or refusing to apportion such assessment may appeal from the decision of such drainage commissioners by giving written notice to the said drainage commissioners within fifteen days after their decision. Such appeal shall be to the chancery court of the county in which the land involved shall be situated, and if the land involved is situated in more than one county, then to the chancery court of either county. When such appeal is requested by any party interested, it shall be the duty of the clerk of the board of drainage commissioners to file with the chancery clerk the petitions requesting the tax apportionment and all papers in connection with the cause, within thirty days after the request of said appeal, if made within the time hereinabove required.

       § 51-29-115.
    Formation of subdrainage districts.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Subdistricts may be formed under this chapter in the following manner: When one third of the landowners owning a majority of the acreage or a majority of the landowners owning a third of the acreage or real property within a proposed subdistrict, composed of lands wholly within a district or partly within and partly without such district, shall petition the chancery court to establish a subdistrict to embrace their property, describing generally the region which it is intended shall be embraced within the subdistrict, and shall file a good bond to pay for the expenses of the survey of the proposed subdistrict in case the district is not formed, it shall be the duty of the chancery court, or chancellor in vacation, to enter an order directing the commissioners of the main district to forthwith proceed to cause a survey to be made and to ascertain the limits of the region which will be benefited by a proposed system of improvements, giving a general idea of its character and the costs of drainage, and making such suggestions as to the size of the drainage ditches and their location as the commissioners may deem advisable, and to file their report with the clerk of the chancery court. All expenses of preparing such plans and estimates and costs of publication shall be paid by the board of supervisors, as the work progresses, upon proper showing by the commissioners of said district; but all expenses incurred by said subdistrict shall be repaid out of the proceeds of the first money received by the proposed subdistrict.
     </p>
     <p>
      The clerk of the chancery court shall thereupon give notice by publication for two weeks by two insertions in some newspaper published in the county or counties in which said subdistrict will be located, calling upon all persons owning real property within said subdistrict to appear before the chancery court, or chancellor in vacation, on some day fixed by said clerk not less than ten days after the last publication to show cause in favor of or against the establishing of the subdistrict. If it shall appear to the court or chancellor that the organization of the proposed subdistrict will conduce to the public benefit and to the interest of real property therein, it shall make an order upon its records establishing said subdistrict. Nothing in this section shall be construed so as to prohibit the formation and organization of a drainage district wholly or partly within a district already organized. A district independent of the district already organized may be organized where a part or all of the lands are not in the district already organized, provided that a third of the landowners owning a majority of the acreage or a majority of the landowners owning a third of the acreage or real property within such proposed district shall petition the chancery court of any county of such district to constitute them a drainage district under the terms of this chapter, and thereupon proceedings shall be had in all respects in conformity with this chapter for the creation of a drainage district under its terms. When such a district is organized as now provided by law for the organization of drainage districts, it shall have all the rights, powers, and privileges of any other district, having its commissioners and other officers selected in the manner now provided by law; and such district shall have full power to make and levy assessments, issue bonds independent of any other district, and to do all other things now provided by law for the formation and organization of drainage districts. When any such district is organized, the several parcels of land thereof that are included within the corporate limits of any district shall still be liable to the district already organized for assessments for benefits thereafter levied, if any are received by them; and in like manner shall receive credit for any work done which is a benefit to the district already organized. The foregoing provisions of this chapter shall apply to the organization of the subdistrict, the same as to the organization of the district.
     </p>
     <p>
      When the court or chancellor has established a subdistrict, he shall appoint the commissioners of the subdistrict; and the proceedings thereafter shall conform in all respects to the provisions of this chapter relating to the drainage district. Said commissioners are empowered and authorized to issue bonds of said subdistrict, and said bonds shall be designated as the bonds of said subdistrict; and all the foregoing provisions of this chapter in reference to the issuance of the bonds of said drainage district shall apply to and govern the issuance of bonds of each particular subdistrict. The proceeds of the sale or money obtained on the bonds of any subdistrict shall be used and applied exclusively to the work of constructing and maintaining the internal drains of said subdistrict in the carrying out and perfecting its internal drains. Separate accounts shall be kept by the treasurer and depositories of said commission with each subdrainage district, so that there can be seen at all times the exact financial condition of each subdistrict, both as to its receipts and disbursements.

      Any drainage district operating under the provisions of this chapter, having as its purpose and object a comprehensive and general plan to control overflow and surplus water of rivers and their tributaries, is hereby given the power, in addition to the foregoing powers given by this chapter, to construct and maintain by-passes for conveying surplus and overflow waters by means of ditches, canals, floodways, levees, conduits, or other artificial means by shorter and more direct route from tributaries of natural streams and their watersheds to their main water course, and from one point in a natural water course to another point therein. However, said by-passes, ditches, canals, floodways, levees, or conduits shall empty the water directly into the same watercourse to which it would naturally flow.

       A landowner has no perpetual right to the continuance of a crossing of a drainage canal separating parts of his property; but merely a right to compensation where no crossing is provided. Beaver Dam Drainage Dist. v. McClain, 241 Miss. 865, 133 So. 2d 615, 1961 Miss. LEXIS 414 (Miss. 1961).

      <p>
       Under this section [Code 1942, § 4739], drainage districts have authority so to construct canals and drains that a landowner whose lands are divided thereby may cross them with farm vehicles, in order to lessen the severance damages.

       A drainage district with local commissioners is a subdivision of the state government with limited jurisdiction and powers and it has only such powers as are expressly granted to it by the statute or as may be necessarily implied from such legislation. Eden Drainage Dist. v. Swaim, 212 Miss. 386, 54 So. 2d 547, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 461 (Miss. 1951).

       A drainage district has no express power or implied power to buy an undivided interest of land except for drainage purposes. Eden Drainage Dist. v. Swaim, 212 Miss. 386, 54 So. 2d 547, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 461 (Miss. 1951).

       While tenants in common may be required to bear their proportionate share of expenditures and disbursements and to pay off proportionately the purchase price for outstanding titles and claims, a drainage district has not the power to spend funds to meet these obligations as a tenant in common with others.

If not determined by mutual agreement by the commissioners of the districts or landowners, either district may petition the board of supervisors, chancellor, or chancery court having jurisdiction to investigate, determine, and adjudicate what damages shall be paid, or what work or relief shall be done or provided by the new district. Such judgment may be enforced by mandamus, as now provided by law, and all existing rights of landowners in an existing district shall be protected and cared for by such new district. An appeal shall lie from such order as provided by this chapter. Such district may use any ditch, levee, or other improvements of an existing drainage district with the consent of the commissioners thereof, and upon such terms, conditions, stipulations, and price as may be made by such existing drainage district.

All expenses of making such survey, preparing the plans and estimates of the costs of the improvements, costs of publication, attorneys’ fees, and other necessary expenses shall be paid as the work progresses by the existing drainage district to which the land and territory is proposed to be added, or by the board of supervisors as the court or chancellor may order. All such expenses shall be repaid out of the first money received from taxes upon the additional lands embraced in such drainage district, or from the sale of bonds from the district as extended, if that be done; but if that be not done, then the board of supervisors shall levy an ad valorem tax upon the land which it was proposed to add to such existing drainage district to repay the costs advanced by such existing drainage district or the board of supervisors, as the case may be.

      At said hearing, if said owner or owners shall have then paid over to the chancery clerk the amount set out in said petition and if all of the holders of not less than 95% in amount of the outstanding original indebtedness of the district and all of the holders of outstanding refunding bonds of said district shall have signified in writing, filed with the clerk of said court, their consent to receive the sum so paid as a credit on the said outstanding indebtedness held by them, the chancellor shall determine whether said amount is the true amount of the assessment of benefits of said district against said tract or tracts then remaining unpaid, whether or not the release of said tract or tracts as prayed for will interfere with the continued functioning of the improvements of said district, and whether or not the proposal of sale as set out in said petition is submitted in good faith and accepted as aforesaid. In event it is found that the sum tendered was the true amount of the assessments of benefits of said district against said tract or tracts remaining unpaid, that a release of said tract or tracts will not interfere with the continued functioning of the improvements made by said district, and that the proposal of sale as set out in said petition was submitted in good faith and accepted as aforesaid, the chancellor shall order an acquittance of said tract or tracts from liability for all the outstanding indebtedness of said district and release said tract or tracts from the boundaries of said district, on condition that the sale so proposed and accepted be consummated and a deed to said tract or tracts be delivered to the United States government, to any agency or instrumentality thereof, or to any corporation organized under an Act of the Congress of the United States for the purpose of engaging in reforestation activities. The effect of such order shall be to render said tract or tracts of land, on delivery of said deed, as fully free of any obligation, lien, or incumbrance arising from its inclusion in said district as if said tract or tracts had never been within said district.

      On the rendition of said order the chancery clerk shall pay over to the board of commissioners of said district the amount so paid in to him, which amount shall be held in a special fund to be deposited with the depository of said district under all protections now provided by law for the deposit of funds of drainage districts. Said special fund shall only be withdrawn thereafter in annual installments of the exact amount of the tax which would have been raised by the levy for the year in question from said tract or tracts, had same not been released from the district, and used by the commissioners only in payment of outstanding indebtedness of the district. However, if the holder or holders of the outstanding indebtedness of the district chargeable against the assessed benefits thereof consent to the release of said land or lands from the district, the sum so paid by the landowners shall be paid to such consenting holders of said indebtedness and immediately credited thereon.

      <p>
       A municipality may perform work on private property in order to alleviate flooding on city streets and to correct drainage problems in the city provided the governing authorities find consistent with fact that to do so will promote the health, comfort and convenience of the inhabitants of the municipality. 1991 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 762.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other than specific situations specified by statute, there is no statutory authority which would permit a municipality to enter into an interlocal agreement with a county whereby the two entities could jointly carry out the flood control and drainage activities on the described property; the best course of action may be for the city and county to pursue local and private legislation approving the property in question as an industrial park and authorizing the work necessary to address the potential flooding issue. Prichard, January 15, 1998, #97-0784.

Such districts may also, in addition to the construction of such drains, construct or erect over the land of others, or over the lands to be acquired by the drainage district or commission for that purpose, such levees as may be necessary to protect or reclaim any lands from overflow from any source.

      In every county in this state in which there is now a drainage district and in which a drainage district may hereafter be created or be proposed to be created under this chapter, the board of supervisors of such county shall select three county drainage commissioners for such county. The term of office of each commissioner shall be six years and until his successor is selected and has qualified, with said terms expiring at two-year intervals to insure the selection of one new commissioner every two years. Any vacancy in office of a county drainage commissioner in any county may be filled by the board of supervisors at any regular meeting of such board, which board is given the authority to fill all unexpired terms of any commissioner in the county.

     <p>
      Every resident citizen of any county, being the owner of land in said county and over 25 years of age, of good reputation, and of sound mind and judgment shall be eligible to hold the office of county drainage commissioner in the county of his residence.
     </p>
     <p>
      If any commissioner shall refuse or neglect to discharge the duties imposed upon him by virtue of this chapter, or shall neglect or refuse to qualify as such commissioner after being selected for such office, the other two commissioners shall proceed to exercise the duties of their office and the business of said drainage district until the next meeting of said board of supervisors, when the office of the party refusing to perform or qualify shall be filled by the selection of another party in his stead.

      After the organization of a drainage district, the commissioners shall elect a secretary and treasurer, who may be a member of the board or may be any person qualified to fill the position. He shall give bond in such sum as the commissioners, with the approval of the chancellor, may determine and shall receive such compensation as the commissioners may allow, subject to approval by the chancellor. Such secretary and treasurer shall receive from the county tax collector, whose duty it shall be to collect, all monies levied by said drainage commissioners. The commissioners, with the approval of the chancellor, may designate the depository for such funds; such depository to be a qualified county depository; and upon their failure so to do, the funds shall be deposited as is now provided by law for funds belonging to the treasury of the county. The drainage commissioners of a district which has no bonds outstanding or which has a surplus fund in the treasury, by and with the approval of the chancellor, may place the surplus funds in a qualified county depository on savings account for six (6) months or more, at a rate of interest of not less than two percent (2%), or may loan said surplus funds on land in the county in which the district is organized, at a rate of interest of not less than six percent (6%) and on such terms and for such time as the chancellor may direct. Any such depository shall be eligible to hold funds of the district to the extent that it is qualified as a depository for county funds.
     </p>
     <p>
      It shall be the duty of the treasurer to keep proper books to be furnished him by the commissioners, in which he shall keep an accurate account of all moneys received by him and of all disbursements of the same. He shall pay out no money except upon the order of a majority of the commissioners, shall carefully preserve on file all orders for the payment of money given him by the commissioners, and shall turn over all books, papers, vouchers, moneys and other property belonging to said district, in his hands as such treasurer, to his successor in office.

     <p>
      Upon the day set for hearing said petition or a day to which same may be continued by the court or chancellor, all parties interested may appear and contest the same; and if the contestants file a petition signed by one third of the landowners in such proposed district owning more than one half of the lands in said district, then said original petition shall be dismissed. The court shall first determine whether the petition filed by the contestants is signed by persons of lawful age who represent one third of the landowners in such proposed district owning more than one half of the lands in said district. If it is so signed, the court or chancellor shall enter an order dismissing the original petition. If it is not so signed, then at the first hearing on the original petition the only questions to be passed upon by the court shall be: first, whether the petition is signed by the number of qualified signers required by this chapter; second, whether the required notices by publications, mail, and posting have been given; third, whether the lands of said proposed drainage district or any part thereof required a combined system of drainage; fourth, whether the creation of the district would meet a public necessity and would be conducive to the public welfare. If the court or chancellor shall find in favor of the petitioners upon all of these points, he shall enter an order to that effect, refer the said petition to the drainage commissioners of said county for proceedings thereon in compliance with this chapter, and fix a day upon which such commissioners shall meet to consider the same, and investigate the lands in the said proposed drainage district. All deeds made for the purpose of defeating or aiding the prayer of such petition, not made in good faith and for a valuable consideration, shall be taken and held to be in fraud of the provisions of this chapter; and the holders thereof shall not be considered as owners thereof in construing the provisions hereof. Upon said first hearing if the court or chancellor shall find that said petition is not signed as required by this chapter or that notices have not been given as required thereby, the court or chancellor may allow the petitioners to amend the same or may continue said petition for further hearing, with leave to the petitioners to give proper affidavit of any two or more signers of the said petition that they have examined said petition, that they are acquainted with the land and locality of such proposed district, and that such petition is signed by the number of landowners required by this chapter who are of lawful age. Such affidavit may be taken by the court or chancellor as prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the court or chancellor shall find against the petitioners upon any one or more of the points above provided, then said petition shall be dismissed; and in any dismissal under this section, all costs shall be adjudged against the petitioners for the organization of said proposed drainage district.

      As soon as may be after such petition shall be referred to said commissioners, or within such time as the court or chancellor may direct, the commissioners shall meet and go upon said lands and examine the same, and the lands over which the work is proposed to be constructed, and determine: first, the starting point, route, and termini of the proposed work, the location and size of the main ditch to be constructed in said drainage district, which in their opinion will successfully drain the said lands, and whether the drainage of the lands in such proposed drainage district is possible or not, provided that any ditch already constructed in such proposed drainage district may be used as a “main”, or part of a main ditch, if found expedient and sufficient for the purposes of the district; second, the probable cost of same, including expenses and court costs; third, what land will be injured or damaged by the proposed work and the probable aggregate amount of damages such lands will sustain by reason of the laying out and construction of such ditch or ditches; fourth, what lands will be benefited by the construction of the proposed work, and whether the aggregate amount of benefits will equal or exceed the cost of the construction of such work. In the examination of such district and determination of the questions for said commissioners to determine, the said commissioners are authorized and empowered to employ an engineer to go with them upon the lands of said district and examine the same, make a map and profile thereof, and an estimate of the size and depth of the ditch or ditches required for main outlets for the drains of said lands, and the probable cost, and a profile thereof.

      All moneys that have been advanced or expended in good faith by parties interested in the organization of any district, necessary for the preliminary work in organization, such as surveys, attorneys’ fees, and incidentals thereto, may be repaid by the drainage commissioners as follows: If the district is organized, to be paid as a part of the costs of said district; but if the organization of the district is denied, the court or chancellor in vacation may make such orders and decrees as may appear to be equitable and just to all parties interested towards providing for the payment of such sums, together with such sums as the commissioners have expended or contracted for in good faith after the reference of the petition to them, and to this end may assess an acreage tax against such lands in such district which were owned by the persons signing the original petition praying that the district might be organized. After the petition for the organization of a district is filed and referred to the commissioners, they are authorized and empowered to issue certificates of the district to raise funds to have all necessary surveys made and to pay all necessary expenses and costs incurred in the preliminary work prior to the organization thereof, which certificates shall bear interest at the rate of 6% from their dates, but no certificate shall be made payable for a longer period than two years from its date. These certificates shall be paid as soon as the district is organized and sufficient funds come into the hands of the commissioners to pay same. Where any district shall fail to be organized solely by reason of the fact that a sufficient number of petitioners signing the original petition withdrew therefrom so as to leave an insufficient number of petitioners or an insufficient acreage represented by the petitioners remaining, and the chancery court or chancellor shall so state in his decree, the entire costs of the proceedings shall be decreed against the lands of such petitioners so withdrawing, on an acreage pro rata basis.

      As soon as practicable after the entry of the order organizing a drainage district, the drainage commissioners shall go upon the lands of said district, examine the same, and assess the benefits to be derived by each separate tract of land for the proposed work, putting down in dollars and cents the amount of such benefits to be derived by such tract. They shall also estimate and put down in another column the amount of damages, if any, that any of the owners of said land may, in the opinion of such commissioners, sustain by reason of the construction of such work over their land in such district; shall make an estimate of the costs of draining said district, apportioned to each tract of land; and shall make and file a schedule or assessment roll of the same, which shall be substantially in the following form:

      Provided that, for the purpose of providing funds with which to clean out, restore, repair and rehabilitate the whole or any part of the drainage system of such district or for the purpose of cooperating with the United States or any agency thereof in such works, there may be imposed a uniform assessment on each acre of unsubdivided land lying within the district, and a uniform assessment by lot on an acreage basis on subdivided land lying within the district, and the records required in this chapter shall show the amount of the assessment in lieu of the amount of benefits to accrue to each tract. Taxes levied hereunder are hereby declared to be taxes for maintenance purposes and shall not diminish in any manner the amount of assessed benefits in any such district which is otherwise available for the payment of any outstanding bonds of such district.

     <p>
      The assessments provided for in this section may be made even though evidences of indebtedness have been issued or validated or both prior thereto, but the lien of the holders of any such indebtedness shall not be impaired thereby.

    Payment of assessments.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      At the time of confirming the assessments of benefits and damages and the estimated costs of the work proposed, the court or chancellor may order the assessments to be paid in installments, in such amounts and at such times as may be convenient for the accomplishment of the work proposed or the payment of bonds issued therefor; otherwise, the whole amount of such assessments shall be payable on the confirmation of such assessments. The assessments and installments thereof shall draw interest at the rate of not exceeding six percent (6%) per annum, payable annually, from the date of the confirmation; but if any owner elects he may pay the whole amount of the assessment and interest against any part of his property, or all of it, before it becomes due and within thirty days from the date of the confirmation of the assessments and benefits and before the issuance of bonds for the district, and all such property paid on shall not be liable for the payment of such bonds and assessments further. All assessments for benefit and assessments for doing the work of the district shall be a lien upon the lands of the district, assessed specifically against such lands which have not had their assessments paid, and shall continue until such assessments are levied and paid. In case any assessment and accrued interest is not paid when due, the specific land against which said assessment is made shall be advertised and sold by the tax collector of the county, as he is required to sell lands delinquent for state or county taxes; and all the provisions of the laws of this state in reference to the sale of lands to enforce the payment of state and county taxes are hereby declared to be and hereby are made a part of this chapter to enforce the payment of the assessments herein authorized to be made. All drainage assessments shall be collected by the tax collector of the county at the same time and in the same manner as are state and county taxes, and the same penalties shall accrue for the nonpayment of drainage assessments as for nonpayment of state and county taxes.
     </p>
     <p>
      At the time of confirming such assessments, the court or chancellor in vacation may authorize the levying of such portions of such assessments as may be necessary to pay the principal and interest on the bonds authorized to be issued, and to carry out the purposes for which the said district was formed and organized.

     <p>
      When the commissioners shall have made their appraisement of the land taken or to be taken, they shall certify the same and file it with the clerk of the chancery court of the county in which the land lies, and if the proceedings be in another county, also with said clerk in the county where the proceedings are had. The clerk shall thereupon set down and fix a time for the hearing of objections to such appraisement, at the request of the commissioners, to be heard by the chancery court or the chancellor in vacation. The clerk shall issue a summons directed to the sheriff of the county or counties of this state in which any landowner or other person interested may reside, commanding him to summon such owner or owners or other interested person to be and appear at the time and place named. If the owner of any land sought to be taken be an infant or person of unsound mind, the summons may be executed on his guardian; and the guardian in such cases is authorized, subject to the approval of the chancellor in term time or vacation, to sell and convey such property and dedicate it thus to the public use, or he may agree upon the damages and thereby bind the ward. If there be no guardian in such case, the chancellor in vacation may, on application of any one in interest, appoint a guardian ad litem to represent such infant or person of unsound mind, whose acts and doings in the premises shall be valid and binding on the ward. The chancellor may require a bond of such guardian ad litem. If the owner of such land be a nonresident of the state or cannot be found, or if the owner be unknown, and this shall apply to any person interested, upon affidavit to that fact being made by the commissioners or by their agent or attorney, service of the summons may be had on any of his agents in charge of the land; or publication shall be made in the manner provided by law for publication for nonresident and unknown parties in chancery suits. If the land belong to a deceased person whose estate is being administered, the summons may be served on the executor or administrator, who shall, for all purposes of this chapter, be authorized to act for the owner, and he shall be responsible on his bond accordingly. Such notice, when published, need only state that the hearing will be for the purpose of confirming the report of the commissioners as to the appraisement of land taken for the use of the district and through which the ditches of the district are to run; it shall contain the names of the owners or persons interested in such land and their post-office address, if known, and if unknown that fact shall be so stated; and it shall further contain a list of the land, described by section numbers, belonging to such nonresident owners and through which the ditches of the district are to run. If any owner is not satisfied with the amount allowed by the commissioners for land taken by reason of the construction of such proposed system according to the plans of said district, he shall file written objections thereto on or before the day named in the summons or notice.

Said commissioners shall file a levy certifying the amount required by them for the construction of such proposed work, and may in said levy order that so much of the benefits or betterments assessed against the lands in such district as will be necessary to defray the costs of said work, to be paid in cash; or said commissioners may in said levy order that the same be paid in not exceeding forty (40) installments, with interest on each installment at a rate of interest not to exceed six percent (6%) per annum. Or, the said commissioners may order in said levy that bonds of said district shall be issued and sold for any amount not exceeding eighty percent (80%) of the assessed value of the benefits or betterments. Said bonds shall be payable in from one (1) to forty (40) years from the date issued, with interest from the date issued at an overall maximum interest rate to maturity not greater than that allowed in Section 75-17-101, payable annually or semiannually, as the court or chancellor in vacation may direct; and it shall be lawful to attach coupons for any part of a year to the bonds maturing the first year.

      On or before the first Monday of September of each year, the drainage commissioners shall levy a tax on the amount of the original or supplemental assessment of benefits, which shall be in the same proportion as the installment authorized and directed by the court to become due that year, and shall certify their levy to the board of supervisors of the county in which the land lies. It shall thereupon become and be the duty of the said board or boards of supervisors to make a levy in accordance with such assessment sufficient to meet the bond obligations issued by the drainage commissioners and the interest accruing thereon, with ten per cent of the amount of such annual payment added for contingent expenses and liabilities in accordance with the decree of the chancellor. The ten per cent additional levy herein provided may be omitted in any one year when it shall appear that the contingent expense fund on hand exceeds twenty per cent of the total amount of bond and interest obligations falling due during the fiscal year. The said levy shall be apportioned and levied on each tract of land or other property in the district in proportion to the benefits assessed, and not in excess thereof. As soon as said levy is made, the secretary of the commissioners, at the expense of the district, shall prepare an assessment record of the district. It shall be a copy of the “assessment roll” provided above, and may contain any number of columns therein in which may be inscribed the levy made each year. He shall place therein the amount of the levy for the year, including interest accruing on the unpaid installments, and the said record shall be certified by the board of drainage commissioners, attested by the seal of the district, and filed with the tax collector of the county in which the land is located. The said secretary shall make a copy for each county in which the lands of the district may be situated, but only the lands situated in such county need be inscribed therein. At the time of confirming such assessment as herein provided, it shall be competent for the court or chancellor in vacation in such order to provide for all details connected with the fixing of the date, form, maturity, and amounts of any and all bonds that are ordered to be issued, and the fixing of the installments for the payment of such bonds. The court or chancellor in vacation may take the matter of such details under advisement for such further orders and decrees in vacation as may be necessary or advisable to perfect the details of same.

    Commissioners to construct and maintain drains.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The commissioners may, after the organization of said district, do any and all acts that may be necessary in and about the surveying, laying out, constructing, repairing, altering, enlarging, cleaning, protecting, and maintaining any drain or ditch or other work for which they have been appointed. They and their successors shall have charge of said ditch in perpetuity, and shall annually see that the same is cleaned out and all obstructions, brush, willow, or other growth removed therefrom, to the end that said ditches shall be kept thoroughly cleaned and in good repair so as to perfectly drain said lands. For those purposes, the commissioners may borrow money in anticipation of the collection of already levied taxes not to exceed in any one (1) fiscal year one percent (1%) of the amount of the benefits assessed against all of the real property in the district, at an overall maximum interest rate to maturity not greater than that allowed in Section 75-17-105. They may issue in evidence thereof tax anticipation warrants, which warrants shall be paid solely and only out of the first funds collected from taxes levied prior to the borrowing of such funds and issuance of such warrants; and they may make additional assessments from time to time, as necessity may require, to pay for the expense of maintaining, cleaning out, and keeping in repair the ditches of said district and meeting the legal obligations of such district. The additional assessment for maintaining, cleaning out, and keeping in repair the ditches of said district and meeting the legal obligations of such district shall be made by the commissioners in the following manner: on or before the first Monday in September of each year the drainage commissioners shall assess on each tract of land or other property in the district, in proportion to the original and supplemental benefits assessed for construction, such an amount as is necessary to pay the expense of maintaining, cleaning out, and keeping in repair the ditches of said district and meeting the legal obligations of such district, and shall certify their assessment to the board of supervisors of the county in which the land lies; and it shall thereupon become and be the duty of the board of supervisors to levy a tax in accordance with such assessment sufficient to meet said expense of maintaining, clearing out, and keeping in repair the ditches of said district. The said tax levied shall be apportioned to and levied on each tract of land or other property in said district in proportion to the original and supplemental benefits assessed for construction, or as otherwise provided by law. As soon as the said tax levy is made, the secretary of the commission, at the expense of the district, shall prepare an assessment record of the district, which may contain any number of columns therein, in which may be inscribed the tax levied each year. He shall place therein the amount of the levy for the year, and the said record shall be certified by the commissioners, attested by the seal of the district, and filed with the tax collector of the county in which the land is located. The said secretary shall make a copy for each county in which any lands of the district may be situated, but only the lands situated in the county need be inscribed therein. Any person aggrieved at the action of the board of supervisors in levying the tax herein provided shall have the same right of appeal as is provided by law for appealing from the action of said board in levying county taxes. All taxes hereunder assessed and levied shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as are state and county taxes, and the same penalties shall accrue for the nonpayment thereof as for nonpayment of state and county taxes. In the event a drainage ditch shall be totally destroyed by the construction of public levees, the drainage district commissioners shall strike the land affected by such destruction from the assessment rolls of the district; but such action shall in no way affect the lien of the bondholders of the district upon such land.

       In proceeding by drainage district for authority to borrow money for maintenance of drainage system, chancellor has no authority, after final judgment establishing it, to release lands from district, but where lands will not be benefited by rehabilitation of drainage system because they involve abandoned drainage ditch which never functioned, such lands should be released from new assessment and levy and commissioners released from clearing out and maintaining abandoned ditch, and chancellor’s release of land from district may be construed as so holding.

       An additional assessment may be made without regard to the present existence of actual and additional material benefits to a particular integrated tract, when it appears “absolutely necessary in order to preserve and maintain the improvements of the district,” and the mere fact that landowner was not apparently benefited from the improvement and maintenance of a certain drainage canal in the district because of his location on high land does not excuse him from bearing his just proportion of the costs of removing obstructions and silt from such lower canal in the district.

      If in the organization of any drainage district and thereafter in the construction of ditches, drains, or other improvements, it shall be necessary to cross under or through any railroad or the right of way thereof, the same may be accomplished in the following manner: Upon filing of the report of the commissioners as to assessments and benefits and damages, they shall make a special report showing the proposed plans, manner, and character of the work as proposed in passing through such right of way, together with an estimate of the costs of same, including all damages that will be sustained by the railroad by virtue of the construction of the proposed work; and upon the hearing of such commissioner’s report, it shall be the duty of said railroad company to appear and show cause why said report should not be confirmed, as other parties interested are required to appear and on the same notice. In such showing it shall be the duty of the railroad company to file with the court, on or before the time set for the hearing, its estimate of the costs of the proposed work, including all damage that will be sustained by it by doing the proposed work. The court or chancellor in vacation shall determine the amount of such costs and damages to the railroad, and said finding shall be final and conclusive adjudication of such matters, unless appealed from in the manner provided for appeals under this chapter. The prosecution of an appeal shall not prevent the drainage commissioners constructing the work as proposed through the railroad right of way, whenever in their discretion it is necessary to do said work. Before beginning the construction of such work through such right of way, the drainage commissioners shall pay to the railroad company, or the chancery clerk for it, the amount of damages adjudicated against the district in the decree appealed from.

      When it shall become necessary, in the course of the construction of the work being done by the drainage commissioners, to pass through said right of way in the manner and according to plans theretofore filed as above provided, it shall be the duty of the drainage commissioners to give notice in writing to said railroad company of its desire to cross said right of way with its construction work on some approximate date, which shall not be less than sixty days from the date of such notice. Said notice shall be served upon any agent or employee of said railroad company upon whom, under the laws of the state, service of process may be had; and the commissioners shall at the same time pay or tender to said railroad company such costs and damages as may have been adjudged against the drainage district, as hereinbefore provided. It shall thereupon be the duty of the railroad company within a reasonable time to complete such construction work across its right of way, according to the aforesaid plans and specifications under the supervision of the engineer employed by said drainage commissioners, or to permit same to be done by the drainage commissioners. Should the railroad company fail, neglect, or refuse to do and perform in good faith said work within the time fixed by said drainage commissioners for the performance thereof, or to permit same to be done, it shall be liable to the drainage district and all persons for any damage it or they may sustain by reason of such failure, and said railroad company may be compelled to perform such work by mandatory injunction issued at the instance of the drainage commissioners.

      When lands are offered for sale for unpaid drainage district taxes and no person will bid therefor the amount of taxes, damages, and costs due, the same shall be struck off to the drainage district wherein the land lies, and otherwise dealt with as lands which are sold to the state for delinquent state and county taxes.

      On petition of one third of the landowners owning one half of the land or one half of the landowners owning one third of the land located in any drainage district, the chancery court, if it be satisfied that the petition contains the percentage of the landowners as outlined above, shall set a date and place for a hearing on the matter and order notice given of the time and the place of said hearing, the same to be set in vacation or term time according to the order of the chancellor. The notice shall be given by three weeks’ publication in a newspaper published or having general circulation in the county where the drainage district is located, and shall be directed substantially to the landowners, lienholders, bondholders, and all others interested in the drainage district referred to. Said notice shall be complete on the publication of the same in the said newspaper for three consecutive weekly issues, the first notice to be at least three weeks before the date of hearing. At the time and place fixed for the hearing or at any other time or place to which the same shall have been lawfully postponed by the chancellor, the said chancery court, if satisfied that the aforesaid conditions have been fulfilled and that all projects of said drainage district have been completed, shall transfer all the duties, power, and authority of any drainage commission or drainage commissioners of any drainage district lying wholly within one county, and impose the same upon the board of supervisors of the county in which the particular drainage district lies. The board of supervisors of the county in which any such completed drainage project lies shall have charge of maintenance, repair, and upkeep of such completed construction project and shall make report of same annually to the chancery court of the county, but no additional compensation shall be allowed the board of supervisors for the discharge of services hereby imposed. It is provided that on the making of the order of transfer, as above outlined, the compensation and authority of any drainage commissioner or set of drainage commissioners regarding any such drainage district, as above outlined, shall immediately cease on the signing of the decree of transfer above provided for.

      If a third of the landowners owning a majority of the acreage or a majority of the landowners owning a third of the acreage of real property within any such district shall petition the chancery court or chancellor in vacation to constitute them a drainage district under the terms hereof, the clerk of the chancery court shall give notice of the application by two weeks’ publication in some newspaper published and having a bona fide circulation in the county or counties in which the lands of said district lie, stating the time when said petition will be heard and the object of said petition. All owners of real property within the district shall have the right to appear and contest the said petition, or support the same. The chancery court, or chancellor in vacation, shall hear the evidence and shall either grant the petition or deny the same, as he may deem it most advantageous to the property owners of the district and to the public benefit. If he grants the petition, the said district shall have all the rights and powers and be subject to all the obligations and provisions provided by the terms of this chapter. If the majority of the landholders or the majority of the owners of the acreage therein petition for the adoption of this chapter, the court or chancellor must make an order declaring that such district shall henceforth be governed by the terms of this chapter, and shall appoint commissioners according to its terms, who shall carry into effect without delay the proposed drainage improvements.

In case any assessment shall be held to be void for want of notice, the said commissioners may, upon motion, be permitted to give such owner due notice and ask for a time to be set by the court or chancellor in vacation. The court or chancellor shall set such time for hearing any and all objections that said landowner may have to such proceedings and assessment, may make such order in reference thereto as justice may require, and shall assess to such landowner his just proportion of the benefits received by him by such proposed work. Thereupon such assessment as to such landowner shall be conclusive.

     <p>
      For the purpose of funding or paying any legal indebtedness, now or hereafter outstanding, of any drainage district organized and existing under any law or laws of the state of Mississippi or that may be hereafter organized under any law of the state, to the extent that same when added to the outstanding bonded indebtedness of the district shall not exceed the balance due to the district on the assessment of land of the district, the drainage commissioners and court for such district may issue bonds of the district aggregating such amount, provided that interest on such indebtedness may not be calculated against the district in determining the amount of such indebtedness. Such funding bonds shall be of such denominations, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding fifty (50) years from their date, shall be issued in such manner, amount or amounts, and shall not bear a greater overall maximum interest rate to maturity than that allowed in Section 75-17-101, payable semiannually, as the administrative or governing authority of the district may determine. Such bonds may be sold at such price and in such manner as the administrative or governing authority may determine, subject, however, to the approval of the court. Any discount or expense resulting from the sale of such funding bonds may be paid out of any available funds of the district. Such funding bonds shall be signed and executed by the drainage commissioners in charge of the district. However, before issuing such funding bonds hereunder, the administrative or governing authority of such district shall give notice of its intention to do so and shall cause such notice to be published in some newspaper having a general circulation in the county of such district. Such publication shall be made once each week for three (3) consecutive weeks prior to the date, to be named therein, when the administrative or governing authority shall meet to hear the objections of any interested person as to why such funding bonds should not be issued and taxes levied, within the amount of the assessed benefits, for the purpose of paying the principal and interest on such bonds. At the time and place fixed for the holding of such hearing, the administrative or governing authority of such district shall hear and dispose of all such objections in a summary manner. Any objector having filed his objections prior to the hearing may appeal from the decision of such administrative or governing authority to the chancery court having jurisdiction of the affairs of said district, on making and filing, within ten (10) days from date of hearing, appeal bond in the penal sum of two hundred dollars ($200.00) approved by the clerk of said chancery court, conditioned to pay all costs which may be adjudged against objector.
     </p>
     <p>
      Taxes for the payment of such bond obligations issued hereunder shall be levied annually on and against the land of the district, as is provided for the levying of other taxes of the district and in proportion to the assessed benefits of the district.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, bonds referred to hereinabove may be issued pursuant to the supplemental powers and authorizations conferred by the provisions of the registered bond act, being Sections 31-21-1 through 31-21-7.

     <p>
      For the purpose of refunding bonded indebtedness, now or hereafter outstanding, of any drainage district organized and existing under any law or laws of the state of Mississippi or that may be hereafter organized under any law of the state, whenever such drainage district is or may hereafter become unable to pay all or any part of the principal and interest on its bonds, or whenever the best interest of the district may require, the drainage commissioners and court for such district may issue refunding bonds of such district in an amount which shall not exceed the aggregate of the amount of bonds to be refunded and accrued interest thereon. Such refunding bonds shall be of such denomination, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding fifty (50) years from their date, shall be issued in such manner, amount or amounts, and shall not bear a greater overall maximum interest rate to maturity than that allowed in Section 75-17-101, payable semiannually, as the administrative or governing authority of the district may determine. Such refunding bonds may be exchanged for the bonds to be refunded, upon consent of the holders thereof, or may be sold at such price and in such manner as the administrative or governing authority may determine, subject however to the approval of the court. Any discount or expense resulting from the sale of such refunding bonds may be paid out of any available funds of the district. If the outstanding bonds shall not have matured, they may be refunded only with the consent of the holder or holders thereof, which consent shall be sufficiently evidenced by the surrender of the bonds to be refunded. Such refunding bonds shall be signed and executed by the drainage commissioners in charge of the district. However, before issuing any refunding bonds hereunder, the administrative and governing authority of such district shall give notice of its intention to do so and shall cause such notice to be published in some newspaper having a general circulation in the county of such district. Such publication shall be made once each week for three (3) consecutive weeks prior to the date, to be named therein, when the administrative or governing authority shall meet to hear the objections of any interested person as to why such refunding bonds should not be issued and taxes levied, in addition to the assessed benefits, for the purpose of paying interest on such bonds. At the time and place fixed for the holding of such hearing, the administrative or governing authority of such district shall hear and dispose of all such objections in a summary manner, and its disposition thereof shall be final and conclusive on all parties.

      Any landowner desiring to take advantage of Sections 51-33-69 through 51-33-73 shall first make application to the drainage commissioners of the district in which his land is located, giving the description of the land sought to be released and whether he desires to pay for the release of such land in cash, or with bonds or coupons, or by credit on judgment rendered against the district for bonds and interest coupons. It shall thereupon be the duty of the drainage commissioners of such district to enter such application upon the minutes of the district and determine and enter upon such minutes the amount which the drainage commissioners find to be a reasonable cash value for the release of such lands. They shall advise such landowner of their action and, if such landowner shall agree in writing to pay such amount, the drainage commissioners shall thereupon notify by registered mail the bondholders of the district, or so many of them as they may be able to ascertain the address of, of such application and request the approval of such bondholders of the release of such land. If the holders of as much as seventy-five per cent of the outstanding bonded indebtedness of the district, including bonds and coupons for which judgment has been rendered against the district but not including bonds or coupons which have become barred by the statutes of limitation, approve such release in writing, the drainage commissioners shall file a petition in the chancery court of the county in which the affairs of the district are being administered, requesting the approval of said court or the chancellor in vacation of the release of such land. They shall state in such petition the description of the land sought to be released, the price to be paid for such release, how such payment is to be made, and the name and address of all known bondholders. There shall be attached to such petition the written approval of such of the bondholders as have approved the release of such land. Upon the filing of such petition the clerk of said court shall fix a day for the hearing thereof, not less than ten days nor more than two weeks from the date of the filing of such petition, and shall cause not less than seven days notice of such hearing to be given by publication in at least one issue of a public newspaper published in the county in which such petition is filed, a copy of which notice shall be mailed by the clerk to each of the known bondholders at the address stated in the petition. The notice so published and mailed shall state the number of acres of land sought to be released, the name of the owner thereof, and the amount to be paid for the release, and shall advise that the matter will be heard at the time and place fixed. Upon the hearing of such petition all bondholders and landowners of the district shall have the right to appear and object, and if the court or the chancellor in vacation be satisfied that the amount which the commissioners have found to be the reasonable cash value for the release of such land is the reasonable cash value thereof and that it would be to the best interest of all bondholders and all others interested that the property be so released, the court or the chancellor in vacation shall enter a decree approving the release of such land; and the drainage commissioners shall be authorized to accept the amount in full settlement and satisfaction of the lien of said assessment of benefits on said land. Upon such amount being paid by such landowners to the drainage commissioners, such land shall be released from such assessment of benefits by proper order spread upon the minutes of such drainage district, and the president and secretary of the board of drainage commissioners of the district shall execute and deliver to the landowner a proper release of said land.

    Audit of records.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      It shall be the duty of the receiver to audit the records of said drainage district so as to show (1) each tract of land originally assessed described with reasonable certainty, (2) the name of the person designated as owner on the original benefit assessment roll, (3) the total amount originally assessed against each tract of land, (4) the total amount of assessed benefits actually paid on each tract of land, (5) the total amount of assessed benefits on each tract of land remaining unpaid and due when the audit is made, and (6) the total amount of unpaid assessments of each tract remaining unpaid but not due. In the event the records of said drainage district have been lost or cannot be found upon diligent search and inquiry, said receiver shall make an audit as best he can, showing the six items above enumerated by taking into consideration the last time annual levy was made as reflected by the order of court, board of supervisors, or other governing authority, and the amount of outstanding and unpaid bonds and interest coupons issued by said drainage district as may be satisfactorily proved to him by the holders of any such bonds, whether said bonds are in their original form or have been reduced to judgment. Said audit shall also show whether or not the bonds issued by said drainage district are in excess of the assessed benefits or other limitations fixed by law at the time such bonds were issued and, if excessive, to what extent. Upon such audit being completed, the receiver shall file the same, together with such supplemental report as he may deem proper or the court may require, and said audit shall be deemed prima facie correct. Upon filing such audit and report, the clerk of said court shall cause to be published once each week for three successive weeks in a newspaper published in said county, or if no newspaper is published in said county, then in some newspaper having a general circulation in said county, a notice and summons directed to all landowners of said drainage district, the holders of its bonds, and judgment holders, that such audit and report of the receiver has been filed in said court and receivership cause and is subject to their inspection and objection. Such notice shall state that unless such landowner, bondholders, or judgment holders shall, on or before the next ensuing term of said court to convene not earlier than thirty days after the first publication, appear and show cause in writing and in detail why said audit is incorrect in any particular, then said audit will be approved and made final, and all parties shall be bound thereby. It shall be the duty of the court to hear and adjudicate all objections made and filed by any landowner or any bondholder, giving to each the right to contest the objection of the other. After all objections have been heard and adjudicated, the court shall enter its final decree, which shall describe with reasonable certainty each tract of land assessed, the name of the owner or the one to whom it was originally assessed, the amount of unpaid benefit assessments which are due and chargeable to each tract, the amount of unpaid benefit assessments which are not due, the names of the bond and judgment holders and the amounts held by each which are found to be legal obligations of said drainage district, and which of such bonds or the percentage thereof are entitled to payment out of the remaining unpaid benefit assessments when collected. Said final decree shall also declare and fix as a statutory lien, paramount to all liens save and except liens for state and county taxes, the amount so found to be owing and unpaid, whether due or not, on each tract of land and shall fix a day, not later than four months after the rendition of said final decree, for the payment of all such unpaid benefit assessments as are found to be then due and owing. Said decree shall also provide for a sale by the receiver of any and all tracts of land therein mentioned on which the amount so assessed and fixed as a lien is due and shall remain unpaid on the day fixed for its payment. Publication of notice of such sale shall be made in manner and form and for the time required by law for the sale of land delinquent for general taxes, such sale to take place at the court house of said county within legal hours on the day named in the published notice of sale. The court may from time to time order further sales of any such land for the remaining assessed benefits which shall later mature. From such final decree any interested landowner and bondholder may appeal to the supreme court in the manner provided by law generally for such appeals.

In such event the receiver shall issue to him a receipt therefor, which shall discharge such tract of land from the lien and assessment fixed against it and may be recorded by the clerk of said court. In the event of a sale the landowner, the bond and judgment holders, or their agent shall have the right to purchase, and sale shall be made to the highest bidder for cash at public outcry. The receiver shall execute to the purchaser an appropriate conveyance of the tract sold for the amount bid, and such sale shall extinguish all claims and demands of the bond and judgment holders against said land for the benefit assessments for which it is sold, whether for the full amount or not, but shall not affect the lien of the bond and judgment holders for any benefit assessments not due.

      It shall be permissible for the landowner and the bond and judgment holders of such bonds as may be adjudicated a lien on unpaid assessed benefits to agree, in writing signed by them and filed with the receiver, to compromise and settle the amount assessed and fixed as a lien on any particular tract of land for such sum as they may agree on. In such event the receiver shall, upon the landowner paying to him the agreed sum, issue to the landowner a receipt for the amount so agreed in full satisfaction of such lien; and such receipt may be recorded by the chancery clerk when signed and acknowledged by the receiver. The bond and judgment holders of such bonds as may be adjudicated a lien on unpaid assessed benefits may act by a common agency appointed by them for this purpose, which appointment shall be in writing and duly acknowledged and recorded in the land deed records of such county.

      All funds received by the receiver, either as payments made by the landowners or by sale of the land as authorized in Section 51-33-83, shall constitute a trust fund in the hands of said receiver for the use and benefit of the bond and judgment holders entitled thereto. The receiver shall make report to court annually and from time to time as the court may order, showing the amount of assessments by him collected. Out of the funds so collected, the court shall order all costs paid. Ten per cent (10%) of the amount collected under said receivership shall, by said receiver, be paid into the state treasury to the credit of the department of audit fund; and the balance remaining shall be paid to the bond and judgment holders entitled thereto in proportion to their respective valid and legal holdings. When all assessed benefits become due and the receiver has collected all that can be collected, either by payment by the landowners or by sale of the land, he shall make final report; and upon paying out all funds in accordance with the orders of the court, the receiver may be finally discharged. Upon the discharge of said receiver, the status quo of the drainage district shall be reestablished by order of the court, or said district may be dissolved as by law permitted.

     <p>
      It is hereby declared, as a matter of legislative determination, that the lands and properties along the waterways and rivers of the state are among its basic resources, that the overflow and surface waters of the state have not heretofore been conserved or fully controlled to realize their full beneficial use, that the control of such waters is necessary to insure adequate protection to the inhabitants of the State of Mississippi and their properties, and to the municipalities of the State of Mississippi, to promote the balanced economic development of the state and to aid in flood control, conservation, and development of lands and property, and of the general health and welfare of the people of the State of Mississippi. It is further determined and declared that the diversion and control of the waters of any rivers on their tributaries and their overflow waters in or near municipalities for the protection and development of domestic, municipal, commercial, industrial, and manufacturing functions, for flood control, and for pollution abatement are, as a matter of public policy, for the general welfare of the entire people of the State of Mississippi.
     </p>
     <p>
      The creation of flood and drainage control districts to control the waters of the rivers of the State of Mississippi or their tributaries and their overflow waters is determined to be necessary and essential to the accomplishment of the aforesaid purposes and this article operates on a subject in which the state at large is interested. All the terms and provisions of this article are to be liberally construed to effectuate the purposes herein set forth, this being a remedial law.

    Petition for creation of district.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any municipality which may be, in whole or in part, a part of a proposed flood and drainage control district organized under the terms of this article, and when authorized by a resolution of a majority of its governing authorities, may petition the chancery court of the county in which the proposed district is located, or the chancery court of either county in which lands to be included in the proposed district are located if the lands to be included in the proposed district are located in two or more counties, to organize and establish a flood and drainage control district and shall set forth in the petition:
     </p>
     <p>
      The proposed name of the district and the areas to be included in the district, the areas to be that area directly or indirectly benefited by or protected from overflow or flood waters by the contemplated flood or drainage control improvements and any area which is necessary to be included in the district to carry out the purposes of this article. Any municipality or any part thereof, or any county or any part thereof, which is subject to overflow or flood from waters of any river or its tributaries, or which benefits from improvements, may be included in the district.
     </p>
     <p>
      The fact that a preliminary report or study to determine the engineering feasibility of constructing flood or drainage control improvements along any river or its tributaries has been made by a competent engineer or engineering firm, or any other competent institution or agency, and that such study or report shows that the construction of such facilities is feasible for flood and drainage control or for any of the other purposes or services contemplated by the legislative declaration of public policy in this article.
     </p>
     <p>
      The necessity and desirability for the construction of such facilities.
     </p>
     <p>
      A general description of the purposes of the contemplated works, a general description of the plan including the lands to be protected by said flood or drainage control improvements or otherwise affected thereby, and maps or plats showing the general location of any flood and drainage control improvements and related facilities. The word “project” when used herein shall mean the general plan and purposes of the flood and drainage control improvements and associated development, as set out in this petition to the chancery court, and the words “project area” shall mean the physical location of any levees, channels, drains, or related facilities and associated development, and those areas which are necessary to be included in the district to carry out the purposes of this article, and the area of the district as shown on the plats filed with the chancery court. The words “related facilities” as used in this article shall mean any facilities which are correlated with or used in connection with the project.
     </p>
     <p>
      The petition shall be filed with as many copies as there are parties defendant. A copy of the preliminary report or study shall be attached to the original petition as an exhibit.
     </p>
     <p>
      It shall not be necessary that any landowners in the counties to be included in said proposed district be named in the petition or made parties defendant. The chancellor of the chancery court in which said petition shall be filed shall have jurisdiction of the entire flood control district and project area for the purposes of this article. Such jurisdiction may be exercised by the chancellor in termtime or in vacation, as provided in this article.

     <p>
      After the filing of the petition, the chancellor shall enter an order fixing the date, either in term time or in vacation, place, and time for a hearing of the cause on the original petition, exhibits, and any answers or other pleadings filed. The chancery clerk shall give notice of such hearing to all persons interested by posting notices thereof at the door of the courthouse of the county or counties in which the district is situated and in at least ten public places in said proposed district, and also by publishing said notice at least once a week for three consecutive weeks in a newspaper published in each of the counties and municipalities proposed to be included in such flood and drainage control district. If there is no newspaper published in any such county or municipality, then it shall be sufficient to publish said notice in a newspaper having a general circulation in such county and municipality. Such notice shall be addressed to the property owners, qualified electors of said proposed district, and all other persons interested, shall state when and in what court said petition was and is filed, shall state the general area included in such district, and shall command all such persons to appear before the chancery court, or the chancellor in vacation, of the county in which said petition was filed and, upon the date fixed by the chancellor, to show cause, if any they can, why the proposed flood and drainage control district should not be organized and established as prayed for in said petition. The date for such hearing shall not be less than five days nor more than forty days after the last publication of such notice. For the purposes of the publication or notice hereinabove mentioned and for the purposes of describing the lands to be included in the district, it shall be sufficient in describing the said lands as all or parts of townships, all or parts of sections, and all or parts of lands lying within the corporate limits of any city, town, or village, and it shall be sufficient to describe the regions and lands proposed to be included in such flood and drainage control district in general terms with a generally accurate description of such regions and lands.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the court or chancellor finds that the notice or publication was not given as provided in this article, it shall not thereby lose jurisdiction, but the court or chancellor shall order due publication or notice to be given and shall continue the hearing until such publication or notice shall be properly given; and the court or chancellor shall thereupon proceed as though publication or notice had been properly given in the first instance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon the entry of said order fixing the date for said hearing, the chancery clerk of said court shall issue a citation to any county or municipality not joining in said petition and in which may lie any part of the proposed district to show cause, if any they can, why the proposed district should not be created as prayed for in said petition, which said citation shall be forthwith served by the sheriff according to law.

     <p>
      Upon the day set for hearing said petition, or a day to which same may be continued by the court or chancellor, all parties interested may appear and contest the same. If upon the hearing of such petition, it is found that such project is feasible from an engineering standpoint and practical, and if the creation of the flood and drainage control district under the terms of this article would meet a public necessity and would be conducive to the public welfare, such court or chancellor shall so find and shall make and enter an order upon the minutes of the said chancery court stating that the said district, under the proposed name thereof, should be organized subject to all of the terms and provisions of this article. The chancellor shall have the power to change, alter, enlarge, diminish, or otherwise vary the areas to be included in such district from those set forth in said petition in such a manner that said district shall best meet the public necessity and be conducive to the public welfare, as disclosed by the evidence at the hearing.

      Any person interested in or aggrieved by the final order of the court or of the chancellor, creating the district or dismissing the petition, and who was a party to the proceedings in the chancery court, may prosecute an appeal therefrom within ten days from the date of such decree by furnishing an appeal bond in the sum of five hundred dollars ($500.00) with two good and sufficient sureties, conditioned to pay all costs of the appeal in the event the decree is affirmed. Such appeal bond shall be subject to the approval of the chancery clerk. When the transcript of the record of the case shall be filed in the office of the supreme court, the appellee having been summoned to appear and answer the appeal, ten days after service of the summons on appellee or his attorney the court shall consider such case as entitled to be heard. Any party to any proceedings in any court involving any of the provisions of this article may waive any time for filing pleadings so as to obtain an earlier hearing.

      To impound, divert, change, alter, or otherwise control overflow water and the surface water of any river or its tributaries within the project area within or without such district at such place or places and in such amount by the diversion of rivers or their tributaries, by the construction of a dam or dams, a levee or levees, a channel or channels, reservoir or reservoirs, works, pumps, plants, and any other necessary or useful related facilities contemplated or described as a part of the project within or without the district. The district is also empowered to construct or otherwise acquire within the project area all works, plants, or other facilities necessary or useful to the project for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this article.
     </p>
     <p>
      To cooperate with the United States of America in the construction of flood and drainage control improvements, for the protection of property, controlling floods, reclaiming overflow lands, and preventing overflows in this state; and for the purpose of operating and maintaining dams, reservoirs, channels, levees, pumps, and other flood control works and improvements which may be constructed by the United States of America or any department or agency thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      When said project, or any part thereof, is to be constructed by the United States of America or any agency or department thereof, to furnish, without cost to the United States of America, all lands, easements, and rights-of-way necessary for the construction of the project or any part thereof; to hold and save the United States free from damages due to said construction; to make, without cost to the United States, any changes, alterations, or relocation of any public utilities, roads, highways, bridges, buildings, or local betterment made necessary by the work; to provide assurances to the United States of America that encroachment on the levees, improved channels, and pond areas will not be permitted; to maintain and operate the improvements after completion thereof in accordance with regulations prescribed by the United States of America or any agency or department thereof; to contribute in cash to the United States of America, or any agency or department thereof, such sums of money as shall be required by the United States of America, or any agency or department thereof, as a condition for the construction of any improvements by the United States or any agency or department thereof; and generally, without being limited by any of the above, to carry out and faithfully perform any obligations cast upon the district as a condition to the construction of any flood control work, project, or improvements by the United States of America, or any agency or department thereof, and to give assurances to the United States of America that the district will so do.

     </p>
     <p>
      3. In drilling and developing, such persons are hereby vested with a special right to have such mineral interest integrated and their lands developed in such drilling unit or units as the State Oil and Gas Board shall establish after due consideration of the rights of all of the owners to be included in the drilling unit.

      To make such changes in location of levees, channels, drains, or related facilities, or other changes, alterations, or modifications in the plan filed with the petition creating the district, which may be necessary for the accomplishment of the general purposes of the district.

      In the event the proposed flood and drainage control district is comprised of lands lying, in whole or in part, in one or more municipalities which are in existence at the time of the creation of such district, and in one or more counties and not falling within the description of (a) or (b) above, each such municipality shall appoint one (1) director and the board of supervisors of each county in which part of the lands of the proposed district lie shall appoint one (1) director. In the event there are one or more new municipalities incorporated within the district after the organization of such district, each such municipality shall be given a director of the district. However, in the event that selection of directors in said manner results in an even number of directors, the Governor of the State of Mississippi shall appoint one (1) additional director who is a member of the State Fair Commission so that there shall be an odd number of directors.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each director shall take and subscribe to the oath of office required by Section 268 of the Constitution of the State of Mississippi, before a chancery clerk, that he will faithfully discharge the duties of the office, which oath shall be filed with the said clerk and by him preserved.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each director shall receive a fee not to exceed such amount as set forth in Section 25-3-69 for attending each meeting of the board and for each day actually spent in attending to the necessary business of the district and shall receive reimbursement for actual expenses thus incurred upon express authorization of the board.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of directors shall annually elect from its number a president and a vice president of the district and such other officers as in the judgment of the board are necessary. The president shall be the chief executive officer of the district and the presiding officer of the board, and shall have the same right to vote as any other director. The vice president shall perform all the duties and exercise all powers conferred by this article upon the president when the president is absent or fails or declines to act, except the president’s right to vote. The board shall also appoint a secretary and a treasurer who may or may not be members of the board, and it may combine these offices. The treasurer shall give bond in the sum of not less than Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00), as set by the board of directors, and each director shall give bond in the sum of not less than Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00), and the premiums on said bonds shall be an expense of the district. The condition of each such bond shall be that the treasurer or director will faithfully perform all duties of the office and account for all money which shall come into his custody as treasurer or director of the district.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the event a county or municipality entitled to appoint a director or directors to the district shall not do so within twenty (20) days from the date of the order of the chancery court creating the district, the chancery court or the chancellor in vacation shall forthwith exercise the right of said county or municipality in appointing a director or directors.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each director shall hold office for a period of four (4) years from the date of his appointment. However, in order to insure continuity of experience among the members of the board of directors in any district created after March 26, 1981, one (1) member of the initial board of directors shall hold office for only one (1) year, one (1) member shall hold office for only two (2) years, and one (1) member shall hold office for only three (3) years, and, at the initial meeting of the board of directors, they shall determine by lot which of their members shall serve for only one (1), two (2), or three (3) years.
     </p>
     <p>
      No person shall be disqualified from serving as a member of the board of directors by virtue of his having previously served as a director, by virtue of his holding any other office, political or otherwise, or by virtue of his not residing in or owning lands in said district.

      Before issuing any revenue bonds hereunder, the board of directors of the district shall adopt a resolution declaring its intention to so issue, stating the amount of bonds proposed to be issued, the purpose for which the bonds are to be issued, and the date upon which the governing body proposes to direct the issuance of such bonds. Such resolution shall be published once a week for at least three (3) consecutive weeks in at least one (1) newspaper published in the district. The first publication of such resolution shall be made not less than twenty-one (21) days prior to the date fixed in such resolution for the issuance of the bonds and the last publication shall be made not more than seven (7) days prior to such date. If no newspaper is published in such district, then such notice shall be given by publishing the resolution for the required time in some newspaper having a general circulation in the district, and, in addition, by posting a copy of such resolution for at least twenty-one (21) days next preceding the date fixed therein at three (3) public places in the district. If twenty percent (20%) or fifteen hundred (1500), whichever is less, of the qualified electors living or owning property in the district shall file a written protest against the issuance of such bonds on or before the date specified in such resolution, then an election on the question of the issuance of such bonds shall be called and held as herein provided. If no such protest be filed, then such bonds may be issued without an election at any time within a period of two (2) years after the date specified in the above-mentioned resolution. However, the board of directors of the district, in its discretion, may nevertheless call an election on the question of the issuance of the bonds, in which event it shall not be necessary to publish the resolution declaring its intention to issue bonds as herein provided.

The election commissioners shall furnish at each voting place a list of the qualified electors residing in the flood and drainage control district who are also qualified electors in such voting district. At such election, all qualified electors residing in said district may vote, the ballots used at such election shall have printed thereon a brief statement of the amount and purpose of the proposed bond issue and the words “FOR THE BOND ISSUE” and “AGAINST THE BOND ISSUE”, and the voter shall vote by placing a cross (x) or check mark (Π) opposite his choice on the proposition.

    Details of bonds.

     </h3>
     <p>
      All such bonds provided by this article shall be negotiable instruments within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code, shall be lithographed or engraved and printed in two (2) or more colors to prevent counterfeiting, shall be in denominations of not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) nor more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), shall be registered as issued, and shall be numbered in a regular series from one (1) upward. Each such bond shall specify on its face the purpose for which it was issued and the total amount authorized to be issued, shall be payable to bearer, and the interest to accrue thereon shall be evidenced by proper coupons to be attached thereto. Such bonds shall bear interest at such rate or rates, not exceeding that allowed in Section 75-17-103, Mississippi Code of 1972. They shall mature annually in such amounts and at such times as shall be provided by the resolution of the board of directors. However, no bond shall have a longer maturity than forty (40) years from the date of issuance thereof. The denomination, form, and place or places of payment of such bonds shall be fixed in the resolution of the board of directors of the district. Such bonds shall be signed by the president and the secretary of such board, with the seal of the district affixed thereto, but the coupons may bear only the facsimile signatures of such president and secretary. All interest accruing on such bonds so issued shall be payable semiannually, except that the first interest coupon attached to any such bond may be for any period not exceeding one (1) year.
     </p>
     <p>
      If so specified in the resolution directing the issuance thereof, such bonds may be called in, paid, or redeemed in inverse numerical order prior to maturity, upon not less than thirty (30) days notice to the paying agent or agents designated in such bonds, and at such premium as may be designated in such bonds. However, in no case shall any premiums exceed the maximum interest rate allowed on such bonds.
     </p>
     <p>
      All such bonds shall contain in substance a statement to the effect that they are secured solely by a pledge of the ad valorem tax levy provided in this article, they do not constitute general obligations of the state of Mississippi or of the counties or municipalities comprising said district, and they are not secured by a pledge of the full faith, credit and resources of said state or of such counties or municipalities.
     </p>
     <p>
      All such bonds as provided for herein shall be sold at public sale as now provided by law. Except as otherwise provided hereinabove, no such sale shall be at a price so low as to require the payment of interest on the money received therefor at more than the maximum interest rate allowed on such bonds computed with relation to the absolute maturity of the bonds, in accordance with standard tables of bond value, excluding from such computation the amount of any premium to be paid on redemption of any bonds prior to maturity.
     </p>
     <p>
      This article shall be full and complete authority for the issuance of the bonds provided for herein, and no restriction or limitation otherwise prescribed by law shall apply herein.

    Authorization for short-term borrowing by certain levee districts.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The board of directors of the district is hereby authorized and empowered, in its discretion, to borrow money from time to time, in an amount not to exceed Nine Hundred Thousand Dollars ($900,000.00) in the aggregate outstanding at any one (1) time, in order to defray expenses of the district for the purpose of acquiring, repairing, maintaining, strengthening and rebuilding dams, reservoirs, channels, levees, pumps and other flood control works and improvements for the district.
     </p>
     <p>
      Before any money is borrowed under the provisions of this section, the board of directors shall adopt a resolution declaring the necessity for such borrowing and specifying the purpose for which the money borrowed is to be expended, the amount to be borrowed, the date or dates of the maturity thereof, and how such indebtedness is to be evidenced. The resolution shall be certified over the signature of the president of the board of directors.
     </p>
     <p>
      The borrowing shall be evidenced by negotiable notes or certificates of indebtedness of the district which shall be signed by the president and secretary of the district. All such notes or certificates of indebtedness shall be offered at public sale by the district after not less than ten (10) days’ advertising in a newspaper having general circulation within the district. Each sale shall be made to the bidder offering the lowest rate of interest or whose bid represents the lowest net cost to the district; however, the rate of interest shall not exceed ten percent (10%). No such notes or certificates of indebtedness shall be issued and sold for less than par and accrued interest. All notes or certificates of indebtedness shall mature in approximately equal installments of principal and interest over a period not to exceed fifteen (15) years from the dates of the issuance thereof. Principal shall be payable annually, and interest shall be payable annually or semiannually; provided, however, that the first payment of principal or interest may be for any period not exceeding one (1) year. Provided, however, if negotiable notes are outstanding from not more than one (1) previous issue authorized under the provisions of this section, then the schedule of payments for a new or supplementary issue may be so adjusted that the schedule of maturities of all notes or series of notes hereunder shall, when combined, mature in approximately equal installments of principal and interest over a period of fifteen (15) years from the date of the new or supplementary issue; or, if a lower interest rate will thereby be secured on notes previously issued and outstanding, a portion of the proceeds of any issue authorized hereunder may be used to refund the balance of the indebtedness previously issued under the authority of this section. Such notes or certificates of indebtedness shall be issued in such form and in such denominations as may be determined by the board of directors and may be made payable at the office of any bank or trust company selected by the board of directors. In such case, funds for the payment of principal and interest due thereon shall be provided in the same manner provided by law for the payment of the principal and interest due on bonds issued by the board of directors.
     </p>
     <p>
      For the prompt payment of notes or certificates of indebtedness at maturity, both principal and interest, there is hereby pledged the avails of the ad valorem tax authorized in Section 51-35-333, Mississippi Code of 1972, and any other available funds of the district designated by the board of directors. Pledged funds shall be paid into a sinking fund and used exclusively for the payment of principal of and interest on the notes or certificates of indebtedness. Until needed for expenditure, monies in the sinking fund may be invested in the same manner as municipalities are authorized by law to invest surplus funds.
     </p>
     <p>
      The proceeds of any notes or certificates of indebtedness issued under the provisions of this section shall be placed in a special fund and shall be expended only for the purpose or purposes for which they were issued as shown by the resolution authorizing the issuance thereof. If a balance shall remain of the proceeds of such notes or certificates of indebtedness after the purpose or purposes for which they were issued shall have been accomplished, such balance shall be used to pay such obligations at or before maturity and may be transferred to any sinking fund previously established for the payment thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      Proceeds from the sale of notes or certificates of indebtedness not immediately necessary for expenditure shall be invested in the same manner as surplus funds of municipalities may be invested.

     <p>
      The Legislature has previously stated its desire to improve the quality of water, prevent soil erosion and alleviate flood damage in Mississippi, and great strides have been made through the use of water impoundment structures constructed through federal watershed construction funding programs. Flood control structures have provided secondary benefits including improvement of water quality and increased recreational opportunities. Flaws have become apparent in the system of maintenance established to protect these flood control structures to the point that many of the structures are in dire need of repair and pose a serious threat to property as well as loss of secondary benefits.

      The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
     </p>
     <p>
      Storm water may contain contaminants which can degrade surface water quality;
     </p>
     <p>
      Due to the volume of water and the rate of flow, storm water runoff can pose a flood hazard to public and private property;
     </p>
     <p>
      The proper management of storm water is of concern to all citizens and is an activity thoroughly affecting the public interest;
     </p>
     <p>
      In certain areas of the state, the health, safety and welfare of the people of this state require efficient management of storm water;
     </p>
     <p>
      Federal regulations require portions of some local governments to develop and implement storm water management programs;
     </p>
     <p>
      There is a need for proper planning, design, construction, operation and maintenance of appropriate measures for the management of storm water; and
     </p>
     <p>
      There is a need to foster cooperation among local governments in addressing concerns resulting from storm water management, therefore it is necessary and desirable to authorize the creation of storm water management districts by counties and municipalities to plan for, design, acquire, construct, operate and maintain appropriate measures for management of storm water.

     <p>
      It is the intent of the Legislature to provide a means, in addition to the incorporation of districts authorized in Sections 19-5-151 through 19-5-207, by which not-for-profit corporations or associations involved in the sale, transmission and distribution of potable water to members of the public and others may convert their entity status from that of a body corporate to that of a body politic, thereby allowing those entities the opportunity to access the tax-exempt capital markets and thereby assuring the State of Mississippi and the customers of those entities of adequate supplies of water at the lowest water rates possible.
